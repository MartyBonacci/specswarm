## Improvement #001 - Framework Compatibility Validation

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Trigger**: TP-001 spec review - Laravel 5.8 + PHP 8.3 incompatibility not identified
**Issue ID**: #001 (from feedback-live.md)
**Priority**: High
**Plugin**: SpecSwarm
**Command**: `/specswarm:specify`

### Problem
When creating a spec for upgrading PHP 7.2 to 8.3, the specify command generated text stating:
> "Laravel 5.8 framework must continue to work with PHP 8.3"

However, **Laravel 5.8 officially supports PHP 7.2-7.4 ONLY**. It does NOT support PHP 8.x.

The spec did not:
1. Detect this version incompatibility
2. Flag it as a blocker
3. Suggest alternative paths (upgrade Laravel first, use patches, etc.)

This could lead users to attempt an impossible upgrade, wasting significant development time.

### Solution
**Status**: Proposed (not yet implemented)

Enhance the `/specswarm:specify` command to add framework compatibility validation:

1. **Parse composer.json** when feature involves dependency upgrades
2. **Extract framework information** (Laravel version, PHP version constraints)
3. **Cross-reference compatibility matrices** for major frameworks:
   - Laravel versions → PHP version support
   - Symfony versions → PHP version support
   - Other major frameworks as needed
4. **Detect incompatibilities** between current versions and target versions
5. **Add BLOCKER section** to spec when incompatibilities found:
   ```markdown
   ## ⚠️ CRITICAL BLOCKERS

   ### Laravel 5.8 + PHP 8.x Incompatibility

   **Issue**: Laravel 5.8 officially supports PHP 7.2-7.4 only.

   **Options**:
   1. Upgrade Laravel first (5.8→6→7→8→9→10→11), THEN upgrade PHP
   2. Use community patches for Laravel 5.8 + PHP 8.x (unsupported, risky)
   3. Stay on PHP 7.4 (supported until November 2025)
   4. Accept risk and test extensively (not recommended)

   **Recommendation**: Upgrade Laravel first for official support.
   ```

### Files to Change
- `plugins/specswarm/commands/specify.md` - Add dependency analysis logic
- Potentially create new utility: `plugins/specswarm/lib/framework-compatibility-checker.sh`

### Impact
**User Experience**:
- Prevents wasted effort on impossible upgrades
- Provides clear guidance on blocker resolution
- Shows plugin understands complex dependency relationships

**Migration**:
- Critical for CustomCult2 - would have saved hours of failed implementation
- Helps user choose correct migration path upfront

**Quality**:
- Significantly improves specify command's technical accuracy
- Shows real-world project awareness
- Prevents specification of impossible requirements

### Validation
**Before Implementation**:
- Spec suggests Laravel 5.8 works with PHP 8.3 ❌

**After Implementation** (when complete):
- [ ] Re-run specify command on same feature description
- [ ] Verify BLOCKER section appears
- [ ] Verify alternative paths suggested
- [ ] Confirm spec recommends Laravel upgrade first
- [ ] Test with other framework/version combinations

### Time to Implement
Estimated: 30-60 minutes
- Research framework compatibility matrices: 10 min
- Design solution approach: 10 min
- Implement in specify.md: 20-30 min
- Test and validate: 10 min

### Notes
This is a **high-value improvement** - framework/language upgrade incompatibilities are common and this fix would help many users beyond just CustomCult2.

Could potentially be extended to:
- Package dependency conflict detection
- Node.js version compatibility (for Laravel Mix, Vite, etc.)
- Database version compatibility
- Extension availability checks

### Status
- [x] Solution designed
- [x] Implementation complete
- [ ] Tested and validated (awaiting TP-001 re-test)
- [x] Documentation updated (specify.md enhanced)

### Implementation Details
**Date Completed**: 2025-10-23
**Time to Implement**: ~20 minutes (actual)
**Files Modified**:
- `plugins/specswarm/commands/specify.md` (lines 112-202)

**What Was Added**:
1. New step 4: "Framework & Dependency Compatibility Check"
2. Upgrade context detection (grep for upgrade keywords)
3. composer.json parsing for PHP and Laravel versions
4. Laravel compatibility matrix (5.8 through 11.x)
5. Blocker section template for incompatibilities
6. Resolution options with recommendations
7. Assumption documentation for compatible paths

**Logic Flow**:
```
Feature description mentions upgrade
  → Detect upgrade keywords
  → Read composer.json
  → Extract framework versions
  → Check compatibility matrix
  → If incompatible: Add BLOCKERS section to spec
  → If compatible: Add assumption about compatibility
```
