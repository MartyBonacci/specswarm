# Task Package: TP-006 - Test /speclabs:orchestrate-feature

**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Phase**: Phase 2 - SpecLabs Orchestration Testing
**Command**: `/speclabs:orchestrate-feature`
**Estimated Duration**: 5-10 minutes (autonomous execution)
**Feature**: 004-laravel-8-x-to-9-x-upgrade

---

## Objective

Test the `/speclabs:orchestrate-feature` command to autonomously execute the ENTIRE feature workflow from spec to completion.

This is a **MAJOR SHIFT** from manual command-by-command testing. We're testing:
- Autonomous multi-step orchestration
- Agent coordination across workflow phases
- Quality when humans aren't in the loop
- Time efficiency vs manual workflow

**Critical Question**: Can orchestration match the 10/10 quality we achieved manually?

---

## Pre-Execution Checklist

**Verify Current State**:
- [ ] Feature 004 spec.md exists (`/home/marty/code-projects/customcult2/features/004-laravel-8-x-to-9-x-upgrade/spec.md`)
- [ ] No plan.md exists yet (orchestration will create it)
- [ ] No tasks.md exists yet (orchestration will create it)
- [ ] On CustomCult2 project directory
- [ ] Git status is clean (Feature 003 committed)

---

## Primary Command

```bash
/speclabs:orchestrate-feature features/004-laravel-8-x-to-9-x-upgrade/
```

**That's it!** This single command should autonomously:
1. Read spec.md
2. Generate plan.md
3. Generate tasks.md
4. Execute all tasks
5. Create implementation docs
6. Mark feature complete
7. Create git commit

---

## What We're Testing

This tests the **AUTONOMOUS ORCHESTRATION** capability - the "killer feature" of SpecLabs.

**Key Questions**:
1. ‚úÖ Does it execute the full workflow autonomously?
2. ‚úÖ Does it ask questions or run fully autonomous?
3. ‚úÖ Quality of generated plan.md vs manual?
4. ‚úÖ Quality of generated tasks.md vs manual?
5. ‚úÖ Quality of code changes vs manual?
6. ‚úÖ Time: Faster or slower than manual workflow?
7. ‚úÖ Error handling: What happens if tasks fail?
8. ‚úÖ Documentation: As comprehensive as manual?

---

## Expected Behavior

**Option A: Fully Autonomous**
```
ü§ñ Starting feature orchestration...
‚úÖ Spec read and validated
üîÑ Generating plan.md... (2-3 min)
üîÑ Generating tasks.md... (1-2 min)
üîÑ Executing tasks... (3-5 min)
‚úÖ Feature 004 complete!
‚úÖ Git commit created
‚è±Ô∏è Total time: 6-10 minutes
```

**Option B: Semi-Autonomous with Checkpoints**
```
ü§ñ Starting feature orchestration...
‚úÖ Plan generated. Continue? [Y/n]
‚úÖ Tasks generated. Execute? [Y/n]
üîÑ Executing tasks...
‚úÖ Feature complete!
```

**Option C: Orchestration Not Ready**
```
‚ùå Command not found or experimental
OR
‚ùå Orchestration encountered errors
```

**We're testing to see WHICH behavior occurs!**

## Comparison Baseline: Manual Workflow Performance

From Features 001-003, we have baseline metrics:

**Manual Workflow Times**:
- Specify: ~1 min (pre-existing)
- Plan: ~2-3 min
- Tasks: ~1-2 min
- Implement: ~2-3 min
- Complete: ~1 min
- **Total**: ~7-10 minutes per feature

**Manual Workflow Quality**: 10/10 across all commands

**Orchestration Target**: Match or exceed manual quality in ‚â§10 minutes

## Potential Issues to Watch For

**Issue #1**: Orchestration not fully implemented
- **Why**: SpecLabs commands are experimental
- **Impact**: Can't test autonomous execution
- **Severity**: High
- **Fallback**: Test other SpecLabs commands or return to manual workflow

**Issue #2**: Quality degradation without human oversight
- **Why**: Agents might skip validation steps
- **Impact**: Lower quality than manual workflow
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Document specific quality gaps for improvement

**Issue #3**: Error recovery failures
- **Why**: Orchestration might not handle task failures gracefully
- **Impact**: Feature incomplete, manual cleanup needed
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Document error handling behavior

**Issue #4**: Time inefficiency
- **Why**: Orchestration overhead might exceed manual workflow
- **Impact**: Slower than manual command-by-command
- **Severity**: Low
- **Analysis**: Still valuable if quality is maintained

**Issue #5**: Over-automation
- **Why**: Orchestration might skip important validation or questions
- **Impact**: Changes made without user confirmation
- **Severity**: Medium (depends on user preference)
- **Analysis**: Good for productivity, but might reduce control

## Post-Execution Analysis

### Questions to Answer:

1. **Readiness Level**:
   - Is orchestration production-ready?
   - Or still experimental/buggy?

2. **Quality Comparison**:
   - Does it match manual workflow quality?
   - What are the specific gaps?

3. **Use Case**:
   - When should users choose orchestration?
   - When should they use manual workflow?

4. **Improvement Opportunities**:
   - What could make orchestration better?
   - What issues need to be fixed?

5. **Value Proposition**:
   - Does orchestration save significant time?
   - Is the quality trade-off worth it?

6. **Next Steps**:
   - Should we test more features with orchestration?
   - Or return to manual workflow?

## Timeline

**Estimated Time**:
- Execution: 5-10 minutes (autonomous)
- Documentation: 10-15 minutes
- Analysis: 5-10 minutes
- **Total**: 20-35 minutes

## Next Steps After TP-006

**If EXCELLENT (Quality ‚â•9/10, Time ‚â§10min)**:
‚Üí Use orchestration for Features 005-006
‚Üí Compare orchestrated vs manual workflow across 6 features
‚Üí Document orchestration best practices

**If GOOD (Quality 7-8/10)**:
‚Üí Document issues for improvement
‚Üí Test one more feature with orchestration (Feature 005)
‚Üí Decide: orchestration or manual for Feature 006

**If POOR (Quality <7/10) or FAILS**:
‚Üí Return to manual workflow for Features 004-006
‚Üí Document orchestration gaps
‚Üí Test other SpecLabs commands instead

## Ready to Execute!

**In Instance B (CustomCult2)**:
1. Ensure git status is clean (Feature 003 committed)
2. Run: `/speclabs:orchestrate-feature features/004-laravel-8-x-to-9-x-upgrade/`
3. **DO NOT INTERVENE** - let orchestration run autonomously
4. Document everything that happens
5. Return to Instance A for analysis

**Let's test autonomous orchestration!** ü§ñüöÄ
