# Task Package: TP-001-RETEST - Validate Framework Compatibility Fix

**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Ready to Execute
**Phase**: Phase 1 - Setup & First Test
**Instance**: Instance B - CustomCult2
**Estimated Duration**: 10-15 minutes
**Type**: Re-test / Validation

---

## Overview

**Goal**: Validate that Improvement #001 (Framework Compatibility Validation) successfully detects the Laravel 5.8 + PHP 8.3 incompatibility and adds a BLOCKERS section to the spec.

**Why This Matters**:
- **Validates rapid iteration process**: We fixed an issue and are immediately testing the fix
- **Confirms improvement works**: The specify command should now detect framework incompatibilities
- **Demonstrates plugin improvement**: Shows our feedback loop is effective

**Dependencies**:
- [x] TP-001 completed with Issue #001 identified
- [x] Improvement #001 implemented in specify.md
- [x] CustomCult2 project has composer.json with Laravel 5.8

---

## What Changed

**Before** (Original TP-001):
- Spec stated "Laravel 5.8 must work with PHP 8.3"
- No blocker identified
- No alternative paths suggested

**After** (With Improvement #001):
- Should detect Laravel 5.8 from composer.json
- Should recognize PHP 8.3 target from feature description
- Should cross-reference compatibility matrix (Laravel 5.8 = PHP 7.2-7.4 only)
- Should add "‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BLOCKERS & DEPENDENCIES" section
- Should suggest 4 resolution options
- Should recommend upgrading Laravel first

---

## Plugin Command

### Primary Command (SAME AS ORIGINAL)

```bash
/specswarm:specify "Upgrade PHP from 7.2 to 8.3 with all breaking changes addressed and Laravel 5.8 compatibility maintained"
```

**Note**: We're using the EXACT same command to see if the improved plugin generates a better spec.

---

## Pre-Execution Setup

### Clean Up Previous Test

Before re-running, we need to clean up the old feature directory:

**Step 1**: Check current state
```bash
cd /home/marty/code-projects/customcult2

# See what features exist
ls -la features/

# Check current branch
git branch --show-current
```

**Step 2**: Clean up (choose one approach):

**Option A - Delete old feature** (Recommended for clean test):
```bash
# Delete the old feature directory
rm -rf features/001-*

# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Delete the feature branch
git branch -D 001-upgrade-php-from-7-2-to-8-3-*
```

**Option B - Keep old for comparison**:
```bash
# Rename old feature for comparison
mv features/001-* features/001-OLD-before-improvement/

# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Delete the old branch
git branch -D 001-upgrade-php-from-7-2-to-8-3-*
```

---

## Expected Outcomes

### New Artifacts

- [ ] New feature directory: `features/001-upgrade-php-from-7-2-to-8-3-*` (probably same long name)
- [ ] New spec.md with **CRITICAL BLOCKERS section** after Overview
- [ ] Blocker section should include:
  - Laravel 5.8 ‚Üí PHP 7.2-7.4 compatibility statement
  - 4 resolution options
  - Recommendation to upgrade Laravel first
  - Impact statement about feature dependencies

### What Should Appear in Spec

Look for this NEW section (should appear after "## Overview"):

```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BLOCKERS & DEPENDENCIES

### Laravel Version Incompatibility

**Issue**: Laravel 5.8 officially supports PHP 7.2 - 7.4 only.

**Current State**:
- Framework: Laravel 5.8
- Target: PHP 8.3
- Compatibility: ‚ùå NOT COMPATIBLE

**Resolution Options**:

1. **Recommended**: Upgrade framework first
   ...

2. **Community Patches**: Use unofficial compatibility patches
   ...

3. **Stay on Compatible Version**: Delay target upgrade
   ...

4. **Accept Risk**: Proceed with unsupported configuration
   ...

**Recommended Path**: [Should recommend Laravel upgrade first]

**Impact on This Feature**: This blocker must be resolved before beginning implementation...
```

---

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Clean Up Previous Test
Follow the cleanup steps above - either delete or rename the old feature directory.

### Step 2: Verify Starting State
```bash
cd /home/marty/code-projects/customcult2

# Should be on main branch
git branch --show-current

# Should have no features/001-* directory
ls features/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No features directory (or it's empty)"

# Confirm Laravel 5.8 in composer.json
grep "laravel/framework" composer.json
```

**Expected**: Should show `"laravel/framework": "5.8.*"`

### Step 3: Execute Improved Specify Command
```bash
/specswarm:specify "Upgrade PHP from 7.2 to 8.3 with all breaking changes addressed and Laravel 5.8 compatibility maintained"
```

**Start timer!** ‚è±Ô∏è

### Step 4: Watch for Improvements

As the command executes, watch for:
- Does it read composer.json?
- Does it mention compatibility checking?
- Does it detect Laravel 5.8?
- Does it recognize the incompatibility?

### Step 5: Validate the Generated Spec

**Critical Check**:
```bash
# View the new spec
cat features/001-*/spec.md | grep -A 20 "CRITICAL BLOCKERS"
```

**Should see**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BLOCKERS & DEPENDENCIES section
- Laravel 5.8 compatibility issue identified
- Resolution options listed
- Recommendation to upgrade Laravel first

### Step 6: Quality Comparison

**Read the full spec and compare to original**:
```bash
cat features/001-*/spec.md | head -100
```

**Compare**:
- Old spec (TP-001): "Laravel 5.8 must work with PHP 8.3" ‚ùå
- New spec (TP-001-RETEST): "Laravel 5.8 incompatible with PHP 8.3" ‚úÖ

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Spec includes "‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BLOCKERS & DEPENDENCIES" section

## After Re-Test

**If successful**:
1. Update improvements-log.md: Mark Improvement #001 as validated ‚úÖ
2. Update metrics.md: Record improvement success
3. Update feedback-live.md: Document validation results
4. Proceed to TP-002 (test plan workflow)

**If issues found**:
1. Document issues in feedback-live.md
2. Create Issue #004 for remaining problems
3. Decide: Fix now or defer
4. Update Improvement #001 with lessons learned

---

## Notes

This re-test is a **critical validation** of our rapid iteration process. If Improvement #001 works, it proves:
- We can identify real issues in plugins
- We can implement fixes quickly (~20 min)
- We can validate fixes immediately
- The plugins are actively improving

This is the **rapid iteration feedback loop** in action! üîÑ
