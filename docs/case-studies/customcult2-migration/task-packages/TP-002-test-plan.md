# Task Package: TP-002 - Test /specswarm:plan Workflow

**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Ready to Execute
**Phase**: Phase 2 - Core Plugin Testing
**Instance**: Instance B - CustomCult2
**Estimated Duration**: 30-45 minutes

---

## Overview

**Goal**: Test the `/specswarm:plan` command by generating an implementation plan from one of the specs created in TP-001-RETEST.

**Why This Matters**:
- **For Migration**: We need implementation plans for the Laravel upgrade path
- **For Plugin Testing**: Tests the second command in the workflow (specify ‚Üí **plan** ‚Üí tasks ‚Üí implement)
- **For Process**: Validates that the workflow chain works end-to-end

**Dependencies**:
- [x] TP-001-RETEST completed successfully
- [x] 6 feature specs generated (001-006)
- [x] Improvement #001 validated
- [x] CustomCult2 project ready

---

## Which Spec Should We Use?

We have 6 specs from TP-001-RETEST. Let's use **Feature 001** (Laravel 5.8 ‚Üí 6.x) because:
- ‚úÖ It's the first in the sequence
- ‚úÖ Smaller scope than the full PHP upgrade
- ‚úÖ Has clear dependencies and constraints
- ‚úÖ Representative of upgrade features

**Location**: `/home/marty/code-projects/customcult2/features/001-laravel-5-8-to-6-x-upgrade/`

---

## Plugin Command

### Check Current Branch First

```bash
cd /home/marty/code-projects/customcult2

# See what branch we're on
git branch --show-current

# See what features exist
ls -la features/
```

### Switch to Feature 001 Branch

The specify command should have created a branch for Feature 001. Switch to it:

```bash
# Find the branch name (should be 001-laravel-5-8-to-6-x-upgrade or similar)
git branch | grep "001-laravel"

# Switch to it
git checkout 001-laravel-5-8-to-6-x-upgrade
```

### Primary Command

```bash
/specswarm:plan
```

**That's it!** The plan command should:
1. Read the spec.md from the current feature directory
2. Analyze the requirements
3. Generate a technical implementation plan
4. Create plan.md in the feature directory

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Artifacts That Should Be Created

- [ ] `features/001-laravel-5-8-to-6-x-upgrade/plan.md` - Implementation plan
- [ ] Plan should be substantial (~1000-2000 words)
- [ ] Should include technical design sections

### Expected Plan Sections

The plan should include:
- **Technical Approach**: How to implement the upgrade
- **Architecture**: What components are affected
- **Database Changes**: Migration considerations
- **Dependencies**: What must be updated
- **Testing Strategy**: How to validate the upgrade
- **Rollback Plan**: How to undo if needed
- **Timeline/Phases**: Implementation sequence

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Plan document created
- [ ] All major technical areas covered
- [ ] Specific to CustomCult2 (mentions ThreeDMod.php, etc.)
- [ ] Actionable guidance provided
- [ ] Dependencies on other features noted
- [ ] Laravel 5.8 ‚Üí 6.x specific breaking changes listed
- [ ] Quality rating >7/10

---

## What We're Testing

### Plan Command Capabilities

1. **Spec Comprehension**: Does it understand the feature spec?
2. **Technical Detail**: Does it provide implementation-level guidance?
3. **Project Awareness**: Does it reference CustomCult2-specific files?
4. **Laravel Knowledge**: Does it know Laravel 5.8 ‚Üí 6.x breaking changes?

## Notes for Plugin Developer (Instance A)

### What to Look For in Feedback

**Critical Evaluation Points**:
1. Did plan read and understand the spec?
2. Did it provide Laravel 5.8 ‚Üí 6.x specific guidance?
3. Did it reference CustomCult2-specific files?
4. Is the plan actionable (could a developer follow it)?
5. Does it include testing strategy?
6. Does it note dependencies (must complete before Feature 002)?

**Common Issues to Watch For**:
- Generic Laravel upgrade advice (not version-specific)
- Missing breaking changes list
- No CustomCult2 context
- Incomplete testing strategy
- Missing rollback plan
- Doesn't consider existing tech stack (React, Three.js, etc.)

### Potential Improvements to Consider

If feedback shows these issues:

**Improvement #002**: Enhance plan command with version-specific knowledge
- Add Laravel version-specific breaking changes database
- Include framework-specific migration guides
- Reference official upgrade guides

**Improvement #003**: Improve project-aware planning
- Analyze codebase structure (large files, critical paths)
- Identify high-risk areas (ThreeDMod.php)
- Suggest testing priority based on file size/complexity

**Improvement #004**: Add testing strategy generator
- Based on feature type (upgrade, new feature, refactor)
- Include unit, integration, and E2E test suggestions
- Reference existing test structure
