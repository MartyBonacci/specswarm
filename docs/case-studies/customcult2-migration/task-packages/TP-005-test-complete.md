# Task Package: TP-005 - Test /specswarm:complete

**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Phase**: Phase 2 - Core Plugin Testing
**Command**: `/specswarm:complete`
**Estimated Duration**: 10-15 minutes
**Feature**: 001-laravel-5-8-to-6-x-upgrade

---

## Objective

Test the `/specswarm:complete` command to finalize Feature 001 (Laravel 5.8 ‚Üí 6.x upgrade) and prepare for Feature 002.

This command should:
- Mark the feature as complete
- Create final documentation
- Potentially create a git commit
- Prepare for next feature in sequence

---

## Pre-Execution Checklist

**Verify Current State**:
- [ ] Feature 001 implementation is complete (TP-004 done)
- [ ] On branch: `001-laravel-5-8-to-6-x-upgrade`
- [ ] All files committed or ready to commit
- [ ] No uncommitted changes blocking completion

---

## Primary Command

```bash
/specswarm:complete
```

**That's it!** The complete command should handle feature finalization autonomously.

---

## What We're Testing

This tests the **final command** in the workflow chain: specify ‚Üí plan ‚Üí tasks ‚Üí implement ‚Üí **complete**

**Key Questions**:
1. ‚úÖ Does it detect Feature 001 is ready to complete?
2. ‚úÖ Does it create a git commit for the feature?
3. ‚úÖ Does it finalize documentation?
4. ‚úÖ Does it update tracking files (tech-stack.md, etc.)?
5. ‚úÖ Does it prepare for Feature 002 (next in sequence)?
6. ‚úÖ Does it suggest next steps?

---

## Expected Behavior

**Possible Outcomes**:

### Option A: Git Commit Created
```
‚úÖ Feature 001 Complete!
‚úÖ Git commit created: "feat: upgrade Laravel 5.8 to 6.x"
‚úÖ Documentation finalized
‚úÖ Ready for Feature 002 (Laravel 6.x ‚Üí 7.x)

Next: Run /specswarm:specify "Upgrade Laravel 6.x to 7.x"
```

### Option B: Completion Summary Only
```
‚úÖ Feature 001 Complete!
‚úÖ Documentation finalized
‚úÖ Summary created

Manual steps:
- Create git commit
- Merge to main (or create PR)
- Begin Feature 002
```

### Option C: Interactive Workflow
```
Feature 001 ready to complete.

Would you like to:
1. Create git commit
2. Create pull request
3. Mark complete without commit
```

**We're testing to see WHICH behavior the command implements!**

### Criteria 3: Git Integration (if applicable)
‚úÖ **PASS**: Either creates commit or provides clear instructions
‚ùå **FAIL**: Leaves git state ambiguous

### Criteria 4: Next Steps Guidance
‚úÖ **PASS**: Suggests Feature 002 or clear next action
‚ùå **FAIL**: No guidance on what to do next

### Criteria 5: Workflow Chain Awareness
‚úÖ **PASS**: Knows Feature 001 blocks Feature 002
‚úÖ **PASS**: Suggests starting Feature 002 (Laravel 6.x ‚Üí 7.x)

## Potential Issues to Watch For

**Issue #1**: Command doesn't detect Feature 001 completion
- **Why**: May require explicit confirmation or testing tasks
- **Impact**: Workflow blocked
- **Severity**: High

**Issue #2**: Git commit created without user approval
- **Why**: Autonomous commit might be too aggressive
- **Impact**: User loses control over git history
- **Severity**: Medium (depends on user preference)

**Issue #3**: No guidance on Feature 002
- **Why**: Might not understand sequential feature dependencies
- **Impact**: User doesn't know next steps
- **Severity**: Low

**Issue #4**: Completion without finalization
- **Why**: Might skip final documentation updates
- **Impact**: Incomplete feature state
- **Severity**: Medium

## Post-Execution Analysis

### Questions to Answer:

1. **Autonomy Level**:
   - Was execution 100% autonomous? (like `/implement`)
   - Or did it require user input?

2. **Git Sophistication**:
   - Does it create commits?
   - Does it create PRs?
   - Or does it provide manual instructions?

3. **Feature Tracking**:
   - Does it update any tracking files?
   - Does it mark Feature 001 as "done"?
   - Does it unblock Feature 002?

4. **User Experience**:
   - Clear output and guidance?
   - Appropriate level of automation?
   - Easy to understand next steps?

5. **Comparison to Implement**:
   - Similar quality to `/implement`?
   - More or less autonomous?
   - Better or worse documentation?

## Timeline

**Estimated Time**:
- Execution: 1-2 minutes
- Documentation: 5-10 minutes
- Analysis: 5 minutes
- **Total**: 10-15 minutes

## Next Steps After TP-005

**If PASS (Quality ‚â•7/10)**:
‚Üí Proceed to Feature 002 creation (TP-006)

**If EXCELLENT (Quality 10/10)**:
‚Üí Celebrate! Then Feature 002

**If FAIL (Quality <7/10)**:
‚Üí Document issues, implement improvements, retest

---

## Ready to Execute!

**In Instance B (CustomCult2)**:
1. Ensure you're on branch `001-laravel-5-8-to-6-x-upgrade`
2. Run: `/specswarm:complete`
3. Document everything that happens
4. Return to Instance A for analysis

**Let's test the completion workflow!** üöÄ
