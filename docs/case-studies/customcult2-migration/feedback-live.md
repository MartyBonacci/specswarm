## Active Issues

### Issue #001 - Critical Laravel 5.8 + PHP 8.x Incompatibility Not Identified

**Time**: [Discovery time during analysis]
**Severity**: **High** (Technical Blocker)
**Status**: Open
**Priority**: Must Fix

**Problem**:
The spec states (lines 38-49):
> "Laravel 5.8 framework must continue to work with PHP 8.3"

However, **Laravel 5.8 officially supports PHP 7.2-7.4 ONLY**. It does NOT officially support PHP 8.x.

This makes the entire upgrade strategy potentially impossible as specified.

**Expected Behavior**:
The specify command should:
1. Read composer.json and detect Laravel 5.8
2. Cross-reference Laravel 5.8 PHP compatibility (7.2-7.4)
3. Identify this as a **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT/BLOCKER**
4. Suggest options:
   - Option A: Upgrade Laravel first (5.8â†’6â†’7â†’8â†’9â†’10â†’11)
   - Option B: Use community patches for Laravel 5.8 + PHP 8.x
   - Option C: Stay on PHP 7.4 (supported until Nov 2025)
   - Option D: Accept risk and test extensively

**Impact**:
- **Migration**: Could lead to wasted effort implementing impossible upgrade
- **User Experience**: User might not discover this until implementation fails
- **Plugin Quality**: Shows spec doesn't validate framework compatibility constraints

**Suggested Fix for Plugin**:
Enhance `/specswarm:specify` command to:
1. Parse composer.json for framework version
2. Check framework's official PHP version support matrix
3. Flag incompatibilities as blockers in spec
4. Provide alternative paths in spec

**Root Cause**:
Specify command doesn't cross-reference dependency version constraints with upgrade targets.

### Issue #002 - Upgrade Path Clarity

**Time**: [Analysis time]
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open
**Priority**: Should Fix

**Problem**:
The incremental upgrade path (7.2â†’7.3â†’7.4â†’8.0â†’8.1â†’8.2â†’8.3) is mentioned only in **Assumptions** section (line 192), buried at the end.

This critical strategy information should be prominent in:
- A dedicated "Upgrade Strategy" section
- The functional requirements
- The overview

**Expected Behavior**:
Spec should have a clear "Upgrade Strategy" or "Migration Approach" section early in the document outlining:
- Direct upgrade vs incremental
- Rationale for chosen approach
- Risk assessment for each approach
- Recommended path with justification

**Impact**:
- **Clarity**: User may miss the incremental path recommendation
- **Actionability**: Planning phase might assume direct upgrade
- **Risk**: Could lead to dangerous direct 7.2â†’8.3 jump

**Suggested Fix**:
Add a dedicated section after "Overview" called "Upgrade Strategy" or "Migration Approach"

### Issue #003 - Feature Directory Name Length

**Time**: [Discovery time]
**Severity**: Low
**Status**: Open
**Priority**: Nice to Have

**Problem**:
Feature directory name is extremely long:
```
001-upgrade-php-from-7-2-to-8-3-with-all-breaking-changes-addressed-and-laravel-5-8-compatibility-maintained
```

Length: ~130 characters

**Issues**:
- Hits Windows path length limits (260 char total path)
- Hard to type/reference
- Unwieldy in git diffs and logs
- May cause issues in some tools

**Expected Behavior**:
Feature directory names should be:
- Concise: 30-50 characters
- Descriptive but brief
- Slug format: `001-php-upgrade-7-2-to-8-3`
- Or: `001-php-upgrade`

**Impact**:
- **Minor**: Mostly cosmetic, but could cause real issues on Windows
- **Developer Experience**: Annoying to work with long paths

**Suggested Fix**:
Limit feature directory names to ~50 characters, generate more concise slugs from feature description.

- [ ] Test fix with re-run of specify (optional)
- [ ] Prepare TP-002 (test plan workflow)

### For User

- [ ] Review this feedback analysis
- [ ] Decide: Fix Issue #001 now, or proceed with TP-002?
- [ ] Switch to Instance B for next task when ready

## Session End State

**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Setup & First Test
**Progress**: TP-001 complete, 1 high-priority improvement identified
**Plugin Quality**: 7/10 - Good with critical oversight
**Next Task**: Implement Improvement #001 OR proceed to TP-002

**Git Status** (CustomCult2 - Instance B):
- Branch: [Probably feature/001-* created by specify command]
- Files changed: [New features/ directory created]
- Commits: [Unknown - awaiting user confirmation]

**Instance Switch**: Ready to implement improvements in Instance A

---

## Notes

**Key Learning**: The specify command generates high-quality, comprehensive specs with good project awareness, BUT it doesn't validate framework version compatibility constraints. This is exactly the kind of real-world issue that would be hard to discover without actual testing.

**Impact**: This test was highly valuable - we found a critical gap in the specify command's logic that could affect many users doing framework or language upgrades.

**Confidence**: High confidence that implementing Issue #001 fix will significantly improve specify command quality for upgrade-related features.
