# CustomCult2 Frontend Upgrade Test Plan

**Purpose**: Validate SpecSwarm v2.1.0 and SpecLabs v2.1.0 plugin features through CustomCult2 frontend modernization

**Date**: October 29, 2025

**Context**: Backend upgrades (Features 001-006) completed successfully using orchestration. Frontend upgrades (Features 007-013) will test NEW v2.1.0 features that were untested during backend phase.

---

## v2.1.0 Features Being Validated

### 1. Parent Branch Detection (UNTESTED - PRIMARY GOAL)

**Feature**: `/specswarm:complete` auto-detects git workflow patterns

**Why This Matters**: Backend used sequential branch (001-laravel-5-8-to-6-x-upgrade) for all 6 features. Never tested individual feature branches or parent branch merging.

**What We're Testing**:
- Individual feature branch workflow: Each feature gets own branch
- Parent branch detection: Does 008 offer to merge into 007?
- Chain merging: 007→008→009→010→...→main
- Completion tags: `feature-XXX-complete` tags for tracking

**Expected Behavior**:
```bash
# After completing Feature 007 on branch 007-vite-migration
/specswarm:complete
# → Merges 007 into main
# → Tags: feature-007-complete

# After completing Feature 008 on branch 008-react-19-upgrade
/specswarm:complete
# → Detects previous feature branch 007-vite-migration
# → Prompts: "Merge into 007-vite-migration instead of main? (y/n)"
# → If yes: merges 008→007
# → Tags: feature-008-complete
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Parent branch detection works for sequential features
- ✅ User can choose merge target (parent branch vs main)
- ✅ Completion tags created correctly
- ✅ No git workflow errors or conflicts

### 2. `--audit` Flag (LIMITED TESTING)

**Feature**: Comprehensive code audit after orchestration

**What We're Testing**:
- 5 automated features × audit reports = good data corpus
- Audit check accuracy (false positives/negatives)
- Actionable recommendations quality
- Security audit effectiveness

**Expected Audits**:
- Compatibility: Language versions, deprecations
- Security: Hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, XSS
- Best Practices: TODOs, error suppression, debug logging

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Audit reports generated in `.speclabs/audit/`
- ✅ Zero false positives (incorrect warnings)
- ✅ Catches real issues (deprecated patterns, security risks)
- ✅ Recommendations are actionable

### 3. `/speclabs:metrics` Dashboard (FIRST REAL USAGE)

**Feature**: Performance analytics for orchestration sessions

**What We're Testing**:
- First meaningful data corpus (6 backend + 5 frontend = 11 sessions)
- Metrics accuracy and usefulness
- Export to CSV functionality
- Pattern identification

**Metrics to Track**:
- Success rate (target: >90%)
- Quality scores (target: >9.0/10)
- Task completion rates
- Phase duration patterns (specify, plan, implementation)
- Time savings vs manual approach

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Metrics dashboard shows all sessions
- ✅ Aggregate statistics accurate
- ✅ CSV export works
- ✅ Metrics inform plugin improvements

### 4. Hybrid Orchestration Strategy (NEW PATTERN)

**Feature**: Mix automated and manual workflows based on complexity

**What We're Testing**:
- When to automate vs when to go manual
- Orchestration boundaries (upgrades vs paradigm shifts)
- Quality differences between approaches

**Strategy**:
- **Automated** (Infrastructure upgrades): Features 007, 008, 009, 012, 013
- **Manual** (Complex modernization): Features 010, 011

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Automated features complete successfully
- ✅ Manual features have fewer orchestration issues
- ✅ Hybrid approach reduces retry count
- ✅ Clear guidelines for when to automate

### 5. Complex Dependency Chains (HARDER THAN BACKEND)

**Feature**: Frontend dependencies more interconnected than backend

**What We're Testing**:
- Can orchestration handle cascading breaking changes?
- React 19 affects: Redux, Three.js, React Router, testing
- Dependency resolution across features

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Orchestration identifies dependency conflicts
- ✅ Breaking changes handled correctly
- ✅ Build succeeds after each feature
- ✅ No runtime errors introduced

## Issues Discovered

### 1. Session Tracking Not Working (Critical)

**Severity**: 🔴 **Critical**
**Component**: Feature orchestration workflow
**Impact**: Metrics dashboard unusable for feature orchestration

**Details**:
- Expected: Session JSON created in `/memory/feature-orchestrator/sessions/`
- Actual: Directory doesn't exist, no session files created
- Task-level orchestration creates sessions correctly (backend migration)
- Feature-level orchestration doesn't create sessions

**Evidence**:
- Backend sessions: 73 files in `/memory/orchestrator/sessions/`
- Frontend sessions: 0 files (directory missing)

**Required Fix**:
1. Create `/memory/feature-orchestrator/sessions/` directory
2. Generate session JSON during feature orchestration
3. Include: session_id, status, phases, quality_score, task_counts
4. Update metrics dashboard to read from both session directories

### 2. `--audit` Flag Doesn't Auto-Execute (Critical)

**Severity**: 🔴 **Critical**
**Component**: SpecLabs orchestrate-feature.md
**Impact**: Manual audit required, inconsistent quality validation

**Details**:
- Expected: Audit runs automatically after implementation with `--audit` flag
- Actual: Audit phase deferred, marked as "pending"
- Flag is recognized (shows in help text)
- Implementation doesn't trigger audit execution

**Evidence**:
- Command: `/speclabs:orchestrate-feature "..." /path --audit`
- Output: "Audit was listed as 'pending' and was deferred"
- Manual audit required to generate report

**Required Fix**:
1. Update orchestrate-feature.md to trigger audit phase after implementation
2. Add conditional: `if [ "$RUN_AUDIT" = "true" ]; then ... fi`
3. Ensure audit report created before completion summary

### 3. Quality Score Not Auto-Calculated (Medium)

**Severity**: 🟡 **Medium**
**Component**: Audit phase logic
**Impact**: Manual calculation required

**Details**:
- Expected: Quality score calculated during audit
- Actual: Manual calculation in audit report
- Formula used: (passed_checks / total_checks) × 100
- Subjective adjustments made manually

**Required Fix**:
1. Implement quality score calculation algorithm
2. Weight categories: Compatibility (40%), Security (40%), Best Practices (20%)
3. Auto-generate score in audit report

### 4. Orchestration Not Fully Autonomous (Medium)

**Severity**: 🟡 **Medium**
**Component**: Clarification phase
**Impact**: Requires user input mid-orchestration

**Details**:
- Expected: Fully autonomous orchestration
- Actual: 3 clarification questions asked mid-flow
- Questions: Asset storage, dev server location, source maps
- Stops orchestration for user input

**Impact**: Not truly "hands-off" automation

**Options**:
1. **Option A**: Include decisions in initial feature description
2. **Option B**: Use sensible defaults, allow overrides
3. **Option C**: Skip clarify phase with `--no-clarify` flag
