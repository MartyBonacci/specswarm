mkdir tweeter-specswarm
cd tweeter-specswarm

# Initialize git
git init

# Create initial README.md
touch README.md
```

#### Step 2: Define Project in README.md

**Open README.md and add the EXACT SAME content as Test 1:**

```markdown
# Tweeter

A simplified Twitter clone from the 140-character limit era.

## Product Vision

Tweeter is a social microblogging platform where users can share short thoughts and interact with others' content. It captures the essence of early Twitter with its 140-character limit, focusing on concise communication and real-time social interaction.

## Core Features

### 1. User Authentication
- User signup with username, email, and password
- User signin with email and password
- Secure session management
- User signout

### 2. Tweet Management
- Create tweets (max 140 characters)
- View tweet feed (newest first)
- View individual tweets
- View user's tweet history

### 3. Social Interactions
- Like tweets
- Unlike tweets
- View like counts

### 4. User Profiles
- User profile pages with bio and avatar
- Edit profile (bio, avatar)
- View other users' profiles
- View user's tweets on their profile

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- React Router v7 (framework mode)
- Programmatic routes (app/routes.ts with RouteConfig)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + Flowbite
- Zod validation
- Functional programming patterns

### Backend
- Express REST APIs
- TypeScript
- JWT authentication with httpOnly cookies
- Zod validation
- Functional programming patterns (not OOP)

### Database
- PostgreSQL (via Neon)
- postgres npm package (camelCase ↔ snake_case mapping)
- 3 tables: profiles, tweets, likes

### Security & Validation
- @node-rs/argon2 (password hashing)
- Zod (frontend UX + backend security)
- uuidv7 (ID generation)

### Storage
- Cloudinary (profile avatars)

## Data Schema

### Profile
- id (string, uuidv7, primary key)
- username (string, unique)
- email (string, unique)
- password_hash (string, argon2)
- bio (string, optional, max 160 chars)
- avatar_url (string, optional, Cloudinary URL)
- created_at (timestamp)

### Tweet
- id (string, uuidv7, primary key)
- profile_id (string, foreign key to profiles)
- content (string, max 140 chars)
- created_at (timestamp)

### Like
- id (string, uuidv7, primary key)
- tweet_id (string, foreign key to tweets)
- profile_id (string, foreign key to profiles)
- created_at (timestamp)
- Unique constraint: (tweet_id, profile_id)

## Authentication Pattern

Following the commonality project approach:
- JWT tokens stored in httpOnly cookies
- Secure token generation and validation
- Protected route middleware
- Automatic token refresh

## API Structure

### Authentication
- POST /api/auth/signup
- POST /api/auth/signin
- POST /api/auth/signout

### Tweets
- GET /api/tweets (get all tweets for feed)
- GET /api/tweets/:id (get single tweet)
- POST /api/tweets (create tweet)
- GET /api/tweets/user/:username (get user's tweets)

### Likes
- POST /api/likes (like a tweet)
- DELETE /api/likes/:id (unlike a tweet)

### Profiles
- GET /api/profiles/:username (get profile)
- PUT /api/profiles/:username (update profile)
- POST /api/profiles/avatar (upload avatar)

## Frontend Routes

Programmatic routing (app/routes.ts):
- / (landing page, public)
- /signup (registration)
- /signin (login)
- /feed (main feed, auth required)
- /profile/:username (user profile)
- /settings (edit profile, auth required)

## Style Guidelines

- Classic Twitter aesthetic (pre-280 character era)
- Blue and white color scheme
- Clean, minimalist design
- Responsive layout
- Focus on readability and usability
```

**Commit the README:**
```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial project definition for Tweeter"
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ Repository initialized
- ✅ README.md with complete project definition (identical to Test 1)
- ✅ Initial commit created
- ✅ Ready for tech stack auto-detection

```

**What Claude Will Do:**
1. Read your README.md
2. **AUTO-DETECT tech stack** from README
3. Create constitution with project standards
4. **Create `/memory/tech-stack.md`** with detected technologies

**Expected Outcome:**
```
🔍 Tech Stack Detection
