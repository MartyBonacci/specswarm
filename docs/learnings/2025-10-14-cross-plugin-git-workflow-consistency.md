# Learning: Cross-Plugin Git Workflow Consistency

**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Scope:** SpecTest, SpecSwarm, SpecLab
**Issue:** Inconsistent git branch management across plugins
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

---

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes git branch management patterns across three plugins and documents the resolution of incomplete git workflows in SpecTest and SpecSwarm.

**Key Finding:** Two distinct patterns emerged:
1. **Feature Workflow** (SpecTest, SpecSwarm): Plugins CREATE branches and implement features
2. **Bugfix Workflow** (SpecLab): Plugin DETECTS existing branches but doesn't create them

**Resolution:** Added complete git workflow management to SpecTest and SpecSwarm. SpecLab requires no changes due to its different operational pattern.

---

## The Discovery

### Initial Problem Report

User noticed SpecTest workflow creating feature branches that were never merged or cleaned up:

```bash
# SpecTest workflow
/spectest:specify "Create user profile system"
  ‚Üí Creates branch: 004-user-profile-system ‚úÖ

/spectest:plan
  ‚Üí Works on 004-user-profile-system ‚úÖ

/spectest:tasks
  ‚Üí Works on 004-user-profile-system ‚úÖ

/spectest:implement
  ‚Üí Completes implementation ‚úÖ
  ‚Üí Still on 004-user-profile-system ‚ùå
  ‚Üí No merge, no cleanup ‚ùå

# User stuck on feature branch!
```

### Cross-Plugin Analysis

Investigation revealed similar patterns across plugins:

| Plugin | Creates Branches? | Cleans Up Branches? | Pattern Type |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| SpecTest | ‚úÖ Yes (specify.md:62) | ‚ùå No (before fix) | Feature workflow |
| SpecSwarm | ‚úÖ Yes (specify.md:62) | ‚ùå No (before fix) | Feature workflow |
| SpecLab | ‚ùå No | N/A | Bugfix workflow |

**Critical Gap:** SpecTest and SpecSwarm were creating branches without providing a path back to main.

---

## Plugin Pattern Analysis

### Pattern 1: Feature Workflow (SpecTest, SpecSwarm)

**Purpose:** Implement complete new features from scratch

**Git Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Branch Creation (specify command)
BRANCH_NAME="${FEATURE_NUM}-${FEATURE_SLUG}"
git checkout -b "$BRANCH_NAME"

# 2. Work on Branch (plan, tasks, implement commands)
# ... feature development happens here ...

# 3. Branch Cleanup (implement command - AFTER FIX)
# Interactive git workflow prompt
# Options: merge, stay, or switch
```

**Why This Pattern?**
- Features are long-lived, complex work
- Isolation from main branch is critical
- Multiple commits expected during development
- Clear feature boundaries (start to completion)

**Branch Naming:**
- Format: `NNN-feature-description`
- Example: `004-user-profile-system`
- Source: Derived from feature specification

---

### Pattern 2: Bugfix Workflow (SpecLab)

**Purpose:** Debug and fix existing bugs in codebase

**Git Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Branch Detection (NOT creation)
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)

if [ -z "$CURRENT_BRANCH" ]; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Not in a git repository"
  echo "üìù Bugfix work will proceed without git integration"
fi

# 2. Work on Current Branch (whatever it is)
# ... bug analysis and fixing happens here ...

# 3. No Branch Management
# User handles git workflow manually
```

**Why This Pattern?**
- Bugs can occur on any branch (main, feature, hotfix)
- SpecLab doesn't know the right branch strategy
- User context determines branch approach
- Multiple bugs may affect different branches

**Branch Context Examples:**
- User on `main`: Small hotfix, quick commit
- User on `feature-branch`: Bug found during feature work
- User on `bugfix/issue-123`: Following team's branching strategy
- User on `hotfix/production`: Emergency production fix

**Why SpecLab Doesn't Create Branches:**

1. **Context Unknown:** SpecLab can't determine:
   - Is this a hotfix for production?
   - Is this part of larger feature work?
   - What's the team's branching strategy?
   - Should this be on main or a branch?

2. **Flexibility Required:**
   - Teams have different git workflows
   - Some use trunk-based development (main only)
   - Some use GitFlow (feature/hotfix/release branches)
   - Some use GitHub Flow (feature branches only)

3. **User Control:**
   - Developers know their workflow
   - SpecLab provides debugging tools
   - Git strategy remains user's choice

---

## The Fix: Interactive Git Workflow

### Implementation Details

Added **Step 10: Git Workflow Completion** to the Post-Implement Hook in both SpecTest and SpecSwarm.

**Location:**
- `plugins/spectest/commands/implement.md` (Step 7 in Post-Implement Hook)
- `plugins/specswarm/commands/implement.md` (Step 10)

**Logic Flow:**

```bash
# 1. Detect Git Repository
if git rev-parse --git-dir >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
  MAIN_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@' || echo "main")

  # 2. Check if on Feature Branch
  if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "$MAIN_BRANCH" ] && [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "master" ]; then

    # 3. Present Options
    echo "üå≥ Git Workflow"
    echo "==============="
    echo ""
    echo "Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
    echo "Main branch: $MAIN_BRANCH"
    echo ""
    echo "Feature implementation complete! What would you like to do?"
    echo ""
    echo "  1. Merge to $MAIN_BRANCH and delete feature branch (recommended)"
    echo "  2. Stay on $CURRENT_BRANCH for additional work"
    echo "  3. Switch to $MAIN_BRANCH without merging (keep branch)"
    echo ""
    read -p "Choose (1/2/3): " GIT_CHOICE

    # 4. Execute User Choice
    case $GIT_CHOICE in
      1) # Merge and delete
        # Check for uncommitted changes
        # Test merge for conflicts (dry run)
        # Execute merge with proper message
        # Delete feature branch
        ;;
      2) # Stay on branch
        # Provide manual merge instructions
        ;;
      3) # Switch without merge
        # Switch to main
        # Preserve feature branch
        # Provide merge/delete instructions
        ;;
    esac
  fi
fi
```

### The Three Options Explained

#### Option 1: Merge and Delete (Recommended)

**Best For:** Normal feature completion

**What Happens:**
```bash
‚úÖ Checking for uncommitted changes...
‚úÖ Testing merge for conflicts (dry run)...
‚úÖ Merging 004-user-profile-system to main
‚úÖ Deleted feature branch 004-user-profile-system
üéâ You are now on main
```

**Safety Features:**
- Detects uncommitted changes, prompts to commit
- Dry-run merge test to detect conflicts
- Aborts on conflicts with clear instructions
- Proper merge commit message: `feat: merge 004-user-profile-system - user profile system`

**Use When:**
- Feature is complete and tested
- Ready to move to next feature
- No additional work needed

---

#### Option 2: Stay on Branch

**Best For:** Additional polish or testing needed

**What Happens:**
```bash
‚úÖ Staying on 004-user-profile-system

When ready to merge, run:
  git checkout main
  git merge 004-user-profile-system
  git branch -d 004-user-profile-system
```

**Use When:**
- Need to add more commits
- Want to run additional tests
- Waiting for code review
- Feature needs polish

---

#### Option 3: Switch Without Merge

**Best For:** Pausing feature work

**What Happens:**
```bash
‚úÖ Switching to main (keeping branch)

Feature branch 004-user-profile-system preserved.
To merge later: git merge 004-user-profile-system
To delete later: git branch -d 004-user-profile-system
```

**Use When:**
- Working on multiple features
- Need to switch context
- Waiting for dependencies
- Pausing feature temporarily

---

## Safety Features

### 1. Conflict Detection

**Dry-Run Merge Test:**
```bash
if git merge --no-commit --no-ff "$CURRENT_BRANCH" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  git merge --abort  # Abort test merge
  # Safe to proceed with actual merge
  git merge "$CURRENT_BRANCH" --no-ff -m "feat: merge $CURRENT_BRANCH - $FEATURE_NAME"
else
  git merge --abort  # Abort test merge
  echo "‚ùå Merge conflicts detected!"
  echo ""
  echo "Cannot auto-merge. Please resolve conflicts manually:"
  echo "  1. git checkout main"
  echo "  2. git merge $CURRENT_BRANCH"
  echo "  3. Resolve conflicts"
  echo "  4. git add . && git commit"
  echo "  5. git branch -d $CURRENT_BRANCH"
  # Stay on feature branch
  git checkout "$CURRENT_BRANCH"
fi
```

**Why This Matters:**
- No partial merges
- No broken state
- Clear manual instructions
- User stays on safe branch

---

### 2. Uncommitted Changes Handling

**Detection and Prompting:**
```bash
if ! git diff-index --quiet HEAD --; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  You have uncommitted changes."
  echo ""
  git status --short
  echo ""
  read -p "Commit these changes first? (yes/no): " COMMIT_CHOICE

  if [[ "$COMMIT_CHOICE" =~ ^[Yy] ]]; then
    read -p "Commit message: " COMMIT_MSG
    git add .
    git commit -m "$COMMIT_MSG"
    echo "‚úÖ Changes committed"
  else
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Proceeding with uncommitted changes (they will be carried over)"
  fi
fi
```

**Why This Matters:**
- No lost work
- User controls commit strategy
- Clear visibility of state
- Flexibility to carry over or commit

---

### 3. Proper Commit Messages

**Format:**
```bash
FEATURE_NAME=$(echo "$CURRENT_BRANCH" | sed 's/^[0-9]*-//')
git merge "$CURRENT_BRANCH" --no-ff -m "feat: merge $CURRENT_BRANCH - $FEATURE_NAME"
```

**Example:**
```
Branch: 004-user-profile-system
Message: feat: merge 004-user-profile-system - user profile system
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Follows conventional commits
- Clear feature identification
- Maintains git history
- Traceable features

## Complete Workflow Comparison

### SpecTest / SpecSwarm (Feature Workflow)

**Before Fix:**
```bash
/spectest:specify "User authentication"
  ‚Üí Creates: 001-user-authentication ‚úÖ
  ‚Üí Switches to: 001-user-authentication ‚úÖ

/spectest:plan
  ‚Üí Works on: 001-user-authentication ‚úÖ

/spectest:tasks
  ‚Üí Works on: 001-user-authentication ‚úÖ

/spectest:implement
  ‚Üí Implements on: 001-user-authentication ‚úÖ
  ‚Üí Ends on: 001-user-authentication ‚ùå
  ‚Üí User stuck! ‚ùå

# Manual cleanup required:
git checkout main
git merge 001-user-authentication
git branch -d 001-user-authentication
```

**After Fix:**
```bash
/spectest:specify "User authentication"
  ‚Üí Creates: 001-user-authentication ‚úÖ
  ‚Üí Switches to: 001-user-authentication ‚úÖ

/spectest:plan
  ‚Üí Works on: 001-user-authentication ‚úÖ

/spectest:tasks
  ‚Üí Works on: 001-user-authentication ‚úÖ

/spectest:implement
  ‚Üí Implements on: 001-user-authentication ‚úÖ
  ‚Üí Interactive git workflow prompt ‚úÖ

üå≥ Git Workflow
===============

Current branch: 001-user-authentication
Main branch: main

Feature implementation complete! What would you like to do?

  1. Merge to main and delete feature branch (recommended)
  2. Stay on 001-user-authentication for additional work
  3. Switch to main without merging (keep branch)

Choose (1/2/3): 1

‚úÖ Merged 001-user-authentication to main
‚úÖ Deleted feature branch 001-user-authentication
üéâ You are now on main

# Next feature ready!
/spectest:specify "Add notifications"
  ‚Üí Creates: 002-add-notifications (from main) ‚úÖ
```

---

### SpecLab (Bugfix Workflow)

**No Changes Required:**
```bash
# User manually creates branch (or stays on current)
git checkout -b bugfix/auth-timeout

/speclab:bugfix "Session timeout not working"
  ‚Üí Detects: bugfix/auth-timeout ‚úÖ
  ‚Üí Works on: bugfix/auth-timeout ‚úÖ
  ‚Üí Implements fixes ‚úÖ
  ‚Üí Ends on: bugfix/auth-timeout ‚úÖ
  ‚Üí No branch management (user's choice) ‚úÖ

# User handles git workflow manually
git checkout main
git merge bugfix/auth-timeout
git branch -d bugfix/auth-timeout
```

**Why No Changes?**
- SpecLab doesn't create branches
- User controls branching strategy
- Flexibility for different workflows
- Respects team conventions

---

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Already on Main Branch

```bash
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "$MAIN_BRANCH" ] && [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "master" ]; then
  # Show workflow
else
  echo "‚ÑπÔ∏è  Already on main branch ($CURRENT_BRANCH)"
fi
```

**Scenario:** User manually switched to main already
**Result:** No prompt, simple info message

---

### 2. Not a Git Repository

```bash
if git rev-parse --git-dir >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  # Git workflow
fi
```

**Scenario:** Non-git project
**Result:** Silently skips git workflow

---

### 3. Uncommitted Changes

```bash
if ! git diff-index --quiet HEAD --; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  You have uncommitted changes."
  git status --short
  read -p "Commit these changes first? (yes/no): " COMMIT_CHOICE
  # Handle response
fi
```

**Scenario:** Uncommitted files in working directory
**Result:** Prompt to commit or carry over

---

### 4. Merge Conflicts

```bash
# Dry run test
if git merge --no-commit --no-ff "$CURRENT_BRANCH" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  # Safe to merge
else
  # Conflicts detected - provide manual instructions
fi
```

**Scenario:** Main branch has conflicting changes
**Result:** Detect before attempting, provide clear manual steps

---

### 5. Invalid User Input

```bash
*)
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Invalid choice. Staying on $CURRENT_BRANCH"
  echo ""
  echo "Git workflow can be completed manually:"
  echo "  ‚Ä¢ Merge: git checkout $MAIN_BRANCH && git merge $CURRENT_BRANCH"
  echo "  ‚Ä¢ Switch: git checkout $MAIN_BRANCH"
  ;;
```

**Scenario:** User enters something other than 1, 2, or 3
**Result:** Fallback to staying on branch with manual instructions

---

## Testing Validation

### Test Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Happy Path (Option 1)**
- Setup: Clean feature branch, no conflicts
- User Choice: 1 (Merge and delete)
- Expected: ‚úÖ Merge succeeds, branch deleted, user on main

**Scenario 2: Stay on Branch (Option 2)**
- Setup: Feature needs testing
- User Choice: 2 (Stay on branch)
- Expected: ‚úÖ User stays, instructions provided

**Scenario 3: Uncommitted Changes**
- Setup: Uncommitted files present
- User Choice: 1, then yes (commit first)
- Expected: ‚úÖ Commit created, merge proceeds

**Scenario 4: Merge Conflicts**
- Setup: Main has conflicting changes
- User Choice: 1
- Expected: ‚ùå Conflict detected, manual instructions, stay on branch

**Scenario 5: Already on Main**
- Setup: User manually switched already
- Expected: ‚úÖ Info message, no prompt

---

## Why Different Patterns Make Sense

### Feature Workflow (SpecTest/SpecSwarm)

**Characteristics:**
- Long-lived work (hours to days)
- Multiple commits expected
- Clear start and end points
- Feature isolation critical
- Safe to automate branch lifecycle

**User Expectation:**
- "I want to implement a feature from scratch"
- "The tool should handle the full workflow"
- "Merge when done, clean up automatically"

**Plugin Role:**
- Create feature branch
- Guide implementation
- Complete git workflow
- Return to clean state

---

### Bugfix Workflow (SpecLab)

**Characteristics:**
- Variable scope (minutes to hours)
- May affect multiple branches
- Context-dependent strategy
- Team conventions vary
- Unsafe to assume branch strategy

**User Expectation:**
- "I have a bug to fix"
- "I'll handle git my way"
- "Just help me debug and fix"

**Plugin Role:**
- Detect existing context
- Guide debugging process
- Respect user's git workflow
- Provide tools, not workflow

---

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements

**1. Pull Request Creation**
```bash
# Detect remote repository
if git remote -v | grep -q github.com; then
  echo "  4. Create pull request instead of direct merge"
  # Integration with gh CLI
fi
```

**2. Pre-Merge Quality Gates**
```bash
# Before merging, run:
- Tests (if test suite exists)
- Linter (if configured)
- Build (if build script exists)
- Checklist validation (if checklists exist)
```

**3. Branch Naming Validation**
```bash
# Ensure consistent naming
if ! [[ "$BRANCH_NAME" =~ ^[0-9]{3}-[a-z0-9-]+$ ]]; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Branch name doesn't match pattern: NNN-feature-name"
fi
```

**4. Metrics Tracking**
```bash
# Record in /memory/metrics.json
{
  "git_workflow": {
    "merge_time": "2025-10-14T15:30:00Z",
    "option_chosen": "merge_and_delete",
    "conflicts_detected": false,
    "feature_duration_days": 2
  }
}
```

## Lessons Learned

### Pattern Recognition

**Discovery:** Different command purposes require different git strategies
- Feature commands: Full lifecycle management appropriate
- Bugfix commands: User control more appropriate
- Context matters more than consistency

### User Experience Design

**Principle:** Complete workflows matter
- Half-finished automations cause friction
- Clear options reduce cognitive load
- Safety features build trust
- Transparency educates users

### Cross-Plugin Consistency

**Balance:** Consistency vs Context
- ‚úÖ Consistent UX where patterns match
- ‚úÖ Different approaches where context differs
- ‚ùå Forcing consistency where it doesn't fit

### Safety First

**Approach:** Validate before executing
- Dry-run merges prevent bad states
- Uncommitted change detection prevents loss
- Clear error messages enable recovery
- Fallback options provide escape hatches
