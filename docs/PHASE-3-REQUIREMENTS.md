# Phase 3: Functional Testing & Runtime Validation

**Status:** 📋 Planned (Requirements Gathered)
**Previous Phase:** Phase 2 Complete (Feature Workflow Engine)
**Target Completion:** TBD
**Priority:** High (based on Phase 2 failure analysis)

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 will add **functional testing and runtime validation** to the orchestrator system. This phase directly addresses limitations discovered in Phase 2, where generated code passed all validation checks but failed at runtime due to invalid API parameters.

**Core Goal:** Ensure that generated code not only compiles and loads, but actually **works** when users interact with it.

---

## Background: Why Phase 3 is Needed

### Phase 2 Success & Limitations

**What Phase 2 Does Well:**
- ✅ Generates structurally correct code (99%+ accuracy)
- ✅ Implements proper architecture patterns
- ✅ Applies security best practices
- ✅ Creates comprehensive feature implementations
- ✅ Fast validation (30-60 seconds)

**What Phase 2 Misses:**
- ❌ Runtime behavior validation
- ❌ External API integration testing
- ❌ User interaction workflows (button clicks, form submissions)
- ❌ API-specific parameter validation

### Real-World Failure Example

**Feature Request:** "Add profile image upload with Cloudinary storage"

**Phase 2 Result:**
- Generated 12 files (~600 lines of code)
- Quality score: 78/100
- All validation passed ✅

**User Testing Result:**
- Feature completely non-functional ❌
- Error: "Invalid extension in transformation: auto"
- Cause: Single invalid Cloudinary API parameter

**Root Cause:** Phase 2 validates code structure but not runtime behavior.

**Impact:** User trust reduced; "Was this orchestrator system supposed to test the functionality?"

See: `docs/learnings/PHASE-2-FAILURE-ANALYSIS-001.md` for full analysis.

---

## Phase 3 Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Functional Testing**
   - Test actual user workflows (click upload, submit form, etc.)
   - Validate end-to-end feature behavior
   - Ensure features work before declaring "complete"

2. **Runtime Validation**
   - Execute generated code in sandboxed environment
   - Capture runtime errors that TypeScript can't catch
   - Validate external API integrations

3. **API Parameter Validation**
   - Check SDK usage against documentation
   - Flag suspicious or deprecated parameters
   - Validate common integration patterns (Cloudinary, Stripe, etc.)

4. **Improved Error Detection**
   - Detect issues before user testing
   - Provide actionable error messages
   - Guide developers to root cause faster

### Success Criteria

Phase 3 will be considered successful when:

- ✅ Functional tests catch runtime failures that pass TypeScript compilation
- ✅ External API integrations are validated (with mocking)
- ✅ User workflows are tested automatically (button clicks, form submissions)
- ✅ Validation time remains reasonable (<5 minutes for typical features)
- ✅ False positive rate is low (<10%)

## Proposed Components

### Component 1: Functional Test Generator

**Purpose:** Generate and execute functional tests for common workflows

**Responsibilities:**
- Detect feature type (form submission, file upload, data mutation)
- Generate Playwright/Puppeteer test scripts
- Execute tests against running dev server
- Report success/failure with screenshots

**Example Test Cases:**
- Upload file → verify upload succeeds
- Submit form → verify data is saved
- Click button → verify expected action occurs
- Load page with data → verify data displays

**Technology:** Playwright or Puppeteer
**Execution Time:** 1-3 minutes per feature

---

### Component 2: External API Integration Validator

**Purpose:** Validate external service integrations without requiring real credentials

**Responsibilities:**
- Detect SDK imports (Cloudinary, Stripe, SendGrid, etc.)
- Parse API method calls and parameters
- Compare parameters against SDK documentation
- Mock API responses during testing
- Flag invalid/deprecated parameters

**Detection Strategy:**
```bash
# Scan generated code for external service usage
grep -r "from 'cloudinary'" → Cloudinary detected
grep -r "from 'stripe'" → Stripe detected
grep -r "from '@sendgrid'" → SendGrid detected
```

**Validation Strategy:**
```typescript
// Example: Validate Cloudinary upload options
const knownInvalidParams = {
  cloudinary: ['format: "auto"'], // Known to cause runtime errors
  stripe: ['currency: "auto"'],
  // etc.
};

// Check generated code against known bad patterns
if (codeContains(knownInvalidParams.cloudinary)) {
  reportError("Invalid Cloudinary parameter detected");
}
```

**Technology:** AST parsing + SDK documentation lookup
**Execution Time:** 10-30 seconds

---

### Component 3: Runtime Error Detector

**Purpose:** Execute generated code and capture runtime errors

**Responsibilities:**
- Spin up isolated test environment
- Execute key code paths
- Monitor for uncaught exceptions
- Capture error stack traces
- Report errors with context

**Approach:**
```bash
# Start server in test mode
NODE_ENV=test npm run dev &

# Execute test scenarios
curl -X POST /api/profiles/avatar -F "avatar=@test.jpg"

# Capture error output
# If error contains "Cloudinary" or "API", flag as integration issue
```

**Technology:** Node.js subprocess execution + error parsing
**Execution Time:** 30-60 seconds

---

### Component 4: Common Pattern Library

**Purpose:** Provide pre-validated code snippets for common integrations

**Responsibilities:**
- Maintain library of proven-correct integration patterns
- Cloudinary upload (with correct parameters)
- Stripe payment processing
- SendGrid email sending
- S3 file storage
- etc.

**Structure:**
```
lib/integration-patterns/
├── cloudinary/
│   ├── avatar-upload.ts        # Proven correct
│   ├── image-transformation.ts
│   └── tests/
├── stripe/
│   ├── payment-intent.ts
│   ├── subscription.ts
│   └── tests/
└── sendgrid/
    ├── send-email.ts
    └── tests/
```

**Usage:**
- When orchestrator detects Cloudinary usage, inject proven pattern
- Reduces risk of API parameter bugs
- All patterns include tests

| Functional Tests | 1-3 min | High |
| API Validation | 10-30s | Medium |
| Runtime Execution | 30-60s | Medium |
| **Total Time** | **3-5 min** | - |

**Trade-off:** Deeper validation takes longer, but catches more issues. Target is <5 minutes total to maintain fast iteration.

---

## Risk Analysis

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Slow validation time** | High | Medium | Parallel execution, caching, time limits |
| **False positives** | Medium | High | Careful test design, allow user overrides |
| **External API rate limits** | Low | Medium | Use mocking, cache API responses |

   - Playwright vs Puppeteer vs Cypress?
   - Decision criteria: Speed, reliability, ease of integration
   - **Recommendation:** Playwright (fastest, most reliable)

2. **Mocking Strategy**
   - Mock at network level (nock) vs SDK level?
   - **Recommendation:** Network level (more realistic)

3. **Test Generation Approach**
   - LLM-generated tests vs template-based?
   - **Recommendation:** Hybrid (templates for common patterns, LLM for custom)

4. **Error Reporting Format**
   - Plain text vs structured JSON vs HTML report?
   - **Recommendation:** Structured with human-readable summary

### Process Decisions

1. **When to run Phase 3 validation?**
   - Always? Only on user request? Only for critical features?
   - **Recommendation:** Always, with time limits and fallback

2. **How to handle validation failures?**
   - Auto-retry with fixes? Report and stop? Ask user?
   - **Recommendation:** Report with suggested fixes, offer auto-retry

3. **Integration with Phase 2 bugfix?**
   - Should Phase 3 failures trigger automatic bugfix workflow?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes, with user confirmation

- ✅ Fewer runtime failures after validation passes
- ✅ Faster debugging when issues do occur
- ✅ Better learning data for improving code generation

**Investment Required:**
- 4-6 weeks development time
- Additional infrastructure (Playwright, mocking)
- Ongoing maintenance of pattern library

**Expected ROI:**
- 90%+ reduction in "passed validation but doesn't work" issues
- Faster overall development (fewer debugging cycles)
- Higher quality code generation over time

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve Phase 3 requirements
2. Prioritize Phase 3 sub-components (3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3)
3. Begin Phase 3.0 implementation (testing infrastructure)
