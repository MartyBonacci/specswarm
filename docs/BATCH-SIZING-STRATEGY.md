# Batch Sizing Strategy - Project Orchestrator

**Date**: October 13, 2025, Post-Test 4A
**Context**: Strategic guidance for optimal work batch sizing
**Status**: Strategic Framework

---

## The Fundamental Question

**"How much work should the Orchestrator build in one batch before checking in with humans?"**

This is THE critical question for practical Project Orchestrator usage. Get it wrong:
- Too small → Overhead kills efficiency
- Too large → Risk of major rework

Get it right → Maximum value with minimal human involvement

---

## Core Insight from Test 4A

**What happened**:
- 6 bugs fixed in 3.83 hours
- Each bug: 15-60 minutes
- Human checkpoint after each bug
- Pattern: Small batches + fast feedback = success

**Key learning**: Batch size should match **confidence level**, not project size.

---

## Measuring Work Size - Three Dimensions

### 1. Time-Based (Most Practical)

**Recommendation: 4-8 hour implementation blocks**

**Why this range?**
- Matches typical "deep work" session
- Can run overnight (sleep → wake to results)
- Human can meaningfully review in 20-30 minutes
- Aligns with agile "half-day sprint" concept

**Evidence from Test 4A**:
```
Bug 901 (Vite config): 15 min
Bug 902 (Tailwind):    25 min
Bug 903 (Backend):     20 min
Bug 904 (Tweet post):  60 min (most complex)
Bug 905 (Styling):     20 min
Bug 906 (Nested a):    25 min
Total:                 165 min (2.75 hours of implementation)
```

**Sweet spot**: 4-6 related tasks taking 4-8 hours total

---

### 2. Complexity-Based

**Simple batch** (2-4 hours):
- Single feature, clear requirements
- Example: "Add tweet timestamps"
- Tasks: 2-3 (backend + frontend + test)
- Human review: 10-15 minutes

**Medium batch** (4-8 hours):
- Multi-component feature
- Example: "Add like functionality"
- Tasks: 4-6 (DB migration + backend API + frontend UI + tests)
- Human review: 20-30 minutes

**Complex batch** (8-12 hours):
- Multiple features or major system
- Example: "User profiles with follow system"
- Tasks: 8-12 (DB + backend + frontend + tests + permissions)
- Human review: 45-60 minutes

**Rule of thumb**: If human review takes >1 hour, batch was too large.

---

### 3. Scope-Based (User Stories)

**Small batch**: 1 complete user story
```
"As a user, I can like tweets"
- Database: Add likes table
- Backend: POST /api/tweets/:id/like
- Frontend: Like button component
- Tests: API + UI tests
Tasks: 3-5
Time: 4-6 hours
```

**Medium batch**: 2-3 related user stories
```
"User can like tweets"
"User can see like counts"
"User can unlike tweets"
Tasks: 8-12
Time: 6-10 hours
```

**Large batch**: Complete epic
```
"User engagement system"
- Likes
- Comments
- Shares
Tasks: 15-25
Time: 12-20 hours
⚠️ RISKY - needs multiple checkpoints!
```

---

## How to Figure Out Optimal Size (Empirical Approach)

### Phase 1: Start Conservative

**Initial batch size**: 4-6 hours (3-5 related tasks)

**Track these metrics**:
```typescript
interface BatchMetrics {
  // Size metrics
  estimatedHours: number;
  actualHours: number;
  taskCount: number;
  linesOfCode: number;
  filesChanged: number;

  // Quality metrics
  iterationsNeeded: number;        // How many fix cycles?
  bugsIntroduced: number;           // New bugs created?
  humanInterventions: number;       // Times human had to step in

  // Review metrics
  humanReviewTime: number;          // Minutes to review
  changesRequested: number;         // Major changes needed?
  approvalTime: number;             // Time to final approval

  // Risk metrics
  blockersEncountered: number;      // Critical blockers hit?
  reworkRequired: boolean;          // Significant rework needed?
  architecturalIssues: boolean;     // Design problems found?
}
```

**After each batch, record**:
```typescript
const batch1: BatchMetrics = {
  estimatedHours: 6,
  actualHours: 6.5,
  taskCount: 5,
  linesOfCode: 347,
  filesChanged: 8,
  iterationsNeeded: 2,
  bugsIntroduced: 1,
  humanInterventions: 1,
  humanReviewTime: 25, // minutes
  changesRequested: 2,
  approvalTime: 35,
  blockersEncountered: 0,
  reworkRequired: false,
  architecturalIssues: false,
};
```

---

### Phase 2: Adaptive Sizing (Learn from Data)

**After 10-20 batches, calculate optimal size**:

```typescript
class BatchSizeOptimizer {
  async recommendBatchSize(
    projectContext: ProjectContext,
    userPreferences: UserPreferences
  ): Promise<BatchRecommendation> {
    // 1. Analyze historical data
    const history = await this.getHistory();

    // 2. Find "sweet spot" where:
    //    - Human review time ≤ 30 minutes
    //    - Success rate ≥ 90%
    //    - Minimal rework needed
    const optimalSize = this.findOptimal(history, {
      maxReviewTime: 30,        // minutes
      targetSuccessRate: 0.9,   // 90%
      maxIterations: 2,         // acceptable rework
    });

    // 3. Adjust for current project complexity
    const adjusted = this.adjustForComplexity(
      optimalSize,
      projectContext.complexity
    );

    return {
      recommendedHours: adjusted.hours,
      recommendedTaskCount: adjusted.tasks,
      confidence: adjusted.confidence,
      reasoning: adjusted.reasoning,
    };
  }

  private findOptimal(
    history: BatchMetrics[],
    constraints: OptimizationConstraints
  ): OptimalSize {
    // Filter successful batches
    const successful = history.filter(batch =>
      batch.humanReviewTime <= constraints.maxReviewTime * 60 &&
      batch.iterationsNeeded <= constraints.maxIterations &&
      !batch.reworkRequired &&
      !batch.architecturalIssues
    );

    // Return median of successful batch sizes
    return {
      hours: this.median(successful.map(b => b.estimatedHours)),
      tasks: this.median(successful.map(b => b.taskCount)),
    };
  }
}
```

**Example results after 20 batches**:
```typescript
{
  '2-4h': { successRate: 0.95, avgReviewTime: 15, reworkRate: 0.05 },
  '4-6h': { successRate: 0.92, avgReviewTime: 25, reworkRate: 0.08 },  // ← Sweet spot
  '6-8h': { successRate: 0.88, avgReviewTime: 35, reworkRate: 0.12 },
  '8-12h': { successRate: 0.75, avgReviewTime: 55, reworkRate: 0.25 },
  '12+h': { successRate: 0.60, avgReviewTime: 90, reworkRate: 0.40 },  // Too large
}
```

## Agile Integration: The Emerging Requirements Problem

### The Reality

**Stakeholders don't know everything upfront!**

From agile development:
- Requirements emerge during development
- Seeing working software sparks new ideas
- Priorities shift based on reality
- "I'll know it when I see it"

**This is NORMAL and EXPECTED.**

---

### Solution: Iterative Batches with Feedback Loops

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Iteration 1: MVP Core (4-6 hours)       │
│ Deliver: Working basic feature          │
└─────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                  │
         Checkpoint: Human reviews
                  │
         ┌────────┴────────┐
         ▼                 ▼
┌──────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐
│ Iteration 2:     │  │ Iteration 2 Alt: │
│ Refinement       │  │ New Direction    │
│ (2-4 hours)      │  │ (4-6 hours)      │
│                  │  │                  │
│ "Polish what     │  │ "Actually, let's │
│  we have"        │  │  do this instead"│
└──────────────────┘  └──────────────────┘
```

**Key insight**: Work in "vertical slices" - each delivers user value and can be demonstrated.

---

## Logical Checkpoints: Vertical Slices

### Bad (Horizontal Slices)

```
❌ Checkpoint 1: "All database schemas done"
❌ Checkpoint 2: "All API endpoints done"
❌ Checkpoint 3: "All UI components done"

Problem: Nothing works until checkpoint 3!
Can't demo anything
Can't get meaningful feedback
High risk of misunderstanding requirements
```

---

### Good (Vertical Slices)

```
✅ Checkpoint 1: "Users can sign up"
   Works end-to-end: DB → API → UI → Tests
   Can demo: Show signup flow
   Get feedback: "Good! But can we have..."

✅ Checkpoint 2: "Users can post tweets"
   Works end-to-end: DB → API → UI → Tests
   Can demo: Show tweet posting
   Get feedback: "Love it! Next, we need..."

✅ Checkpoint 3: "Users can like tweets"
   Works end-to-end: DB → API → UI → Tests
   Can demo: Show liking functionality
   Get feedback: "Perfect! Also..."
```

**Benefit**: Something valuable after EACH checkpoint.

---

### Vertical Slice Definition

A vertical slice must:
1. ✅ Work end-to-end (database → backend → frontend)
2. ✅ Provide user value (user can accomplish something)
3. ✅ Be demonstrable (can show it working)
4. ✅ Be independent (doesn't block other work)

**Test**: Can you demo this to a stakeholder? If yes → good slice. If no → need more.

---

## Recommended Batch Sizes by Scenario

### Scenario 1: Brand New Project (Greenfield)

**Context**: High uncertainty, no existing code, exploring requirements

**Batch size: SMALL (2-4 hours)**

**Why?**
- Don't know what we really want yet
- Requirements will emerge
- Need rapid feedback to course-correct
- Low cost to pivot

**Example: Building Twitter Clone from Scratch**

```
Sprint 0: Project Setup (2 hours)
  - Scaffolding
  - Database connection
  - Basic routing
  ↓
  CHECKPOINT: "Project structure looks good?"
  ↓
Sprint 1: Auth MVP (4 hours)
  - Signup only (no signin yet)
  - Basic session management
  ↓
  CHECKPOINT: "Auth working? Ready for core feature?"
  ↓
Sprint 2: Tweet Posting (4 hours)
  - Post tweets
  - View feed (simple)
  ↓
  CHECKPOINT: "This feels right? What's missing?"
  Human: "Actually, signin is more important than likes"
  ↓
Sprint 3: Signin (2 hours) [Adjusted based on feedback]
  ↓
  CHECKPOINT: "Now ready for likes or profiles?"
  [Stakeholder decides based on seeing Sprint 2-3]
```

**Benefits**:
- See progress every 2-4 hours
- Can pivot easily (small sunk cost)
- Stakeholder stays engaged
- Requirements clarify quickly

---

### Scenario 2: Extending Existing Project

**Context**: Established codebase, patterns known, lower uncertainty

**Batch size: MEDIUM (4-8 hours)**

**Why?**
- Lower uncertainty (patterns established)
- Can predict complexity better
- Less risk of major surprises
- More efficient (less checkpoint overhead)

**Example: Adding Comments to Tweeter**

```
Sprint 1: Complete Comments Feature (6 hours)
  - Database migration (comments table)
  - Backend API (CRUD endpoints)
  - Frontend UI (comment form + list)
  - Tests (API + integration)
  ↓
  CHECKPOINT: "Comments work! But users want..."
  Human: "Great! Can we have edit/delete? And nested replies?"
  ↓
Sprint 2: Comment Refinements (4 hours)
  - Edit comment
  - Delete comment
  - Nested replies (1 level)
  [Based on Sprint 1 feedback]
  ↓
  CHECKPOINT: "This covers everything?"
  Human: "Perfect! Next, let's do..."
```

---

### Scenario 3: Well-Defined Requirements

**Context**: Clear spec, mock-ups provided, low uncertainty

**Batch size: LARGE (8-12 hours)**

**Why?**
- Requirements crystal clear
- Low risk of misunderstanding
- Can work longer between checkpoints
- More efficient execution

**Example: Implementing Designed Feature**

```
Sprint 1: User Profiles (Complete) (10 hours)
  - Profile page with all planned elements
  - Edit profile functionality
  - Avatar upload
  - Bio/location fields
  - Follow/unfollow buttons
  - Follower/following counts
  - Full test coverage
  - Responsive design
  ↓
  CHECKPOINT: "Matches the design spec?"
  Human reviews against mockups
  Human: "Looks perfect! Just change button color..."
  ↓
Minor tweaks (2 hours)
  ↓
Done! Ship it.
```

**Caution**: Only use large batches when certainty is HIGH.

---

## The "Goldilocks Rule"

### Too Small (<2 hours)

**Problems**:
- ❌ Overhead of frequent checkpoints
- ❌ Human context switching
- ❌ Doesn't demonstrate enough value
- ❌ Feels slow/inefficient

**When to use**:
- Extremely high risk
- Critical feature (can't afford mistakes)
- Exploring completely unknown territory

**Example**: First AI/ML feature, high-security feature

---

### Too Large (>12 hours)

**Problems**:
- ❌ Long time until feedback (overnight → next evening)
- ❌ High rework cost if direction was wrong
- ❌ Human review becomes exhausting (>1 hour)
- ❌ Architectural issues discovered late
- ❌ Harder to maintain quality throughout

**When to use**:
- Requirements 100% crystal clear
- Very low risk
- Repeating established pattern

**Example**: Fifth similar CRUD feature, well-understood boilerplate

---

### Just Right (4-8 hours)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Meaningful progress demonstrated
- ✅ Human review manageable (20-30 min)
- ✅ Low rework risk
- ✅ Fast enough feedback
- ✅ Efficient use of time

**When to use**:
- Most scenarios (default choice!)

**Example**: Any typical feature development

---

## Progressive Disclosure Pattern

**Match batch size to certainty level:**

```typescript
type CertaintyLevel = 'exploration' | 'refinement' | 'execution';

function recommendBatchSize(certainty: CertaintyLevel): BatchConfig {
  switch(certainty) {
    case 'exploration':
      // "We're figuring out what we want"
      return {
        hours: 2-4,
        checkpointFrequency: 'after every feature',
        humanExpectation: 'Show options, discuss direction',
        riskTolerance: 'low',
        examplePhrase: "Let's try this and see how it feels",
      };

    case 'refinement':
      // "We know roughly what we want"
      return {
        hours: 4-8,
        checkpointFrequency: 'every 2-3 features',
        humanExpectation: 'Working feature, minor adjustments expected',
        riskTolerance: 'medium',
        examplePhrase: "Build X, we might tweak the details",
      };

    case 'execution':
      // "We know exactly what we want"
      return {
        hours: 8-12,
        checkpointFrequency: 'major milestones only',
        humanExpectation: 'Complete implementation matching spec',
        riskTolerance: 'high',
        examplePhrase: "Here's the spec, build it exactly",
      };
  }
}
```

**Progression over time**:
```
Project Start → Exploration (small batches)
      ↓
Requirements Clear → Refinement (medium batches)
      ↓
Patterns Established → Execution (larger batches)
```

## Real-World Example: Twitter Clone Development

### Traditional Waterfall (DON'T DO THIS)

```
Week 1-2: Complete all planning (40 hours)
  - Write full requirements doc
  - Create all wireframes
  - Plan all features

Week 3-6: Build entire app (160 hours)
  - Authentication
  - Tweet system
  - Likes
  - Profiles
  - Comments
  [No checkpoints, no feedback]

Week 7: Show to stakeholder (2 hours)
Stakeholder: "This isn't what I wanted at all..."

Result: 200+ hours, major rework needed
```

---

### Agile with Project Orchestrator (DO THIS)

```
Day 1 - Monday Evening (7 PM)
You: "Build Twitter clone MVP: auth + tweet posting"
Orchestrator: Plans 6-hour batch
  - Sprint plan: 2 features (auth, tweets)
  - Estimated completion: 1 AM

Day 2 - Tuesday Morning (8 AM)
CHECKPOINT 1: Review overnight work
You review: Auth + tweet posting (15 minutes)
You: "Perfect! This is exactly the core I wanted."
You: "But I want likes more than profiles next."

Day 2 - Tuesday Evening (7 PM)
You: "Add like functionality"
Orchestrator: Plans 4-hour batch
  - Estimated completion: 11 PM

Day 2 - Tuesday Night (11 PM)
You check progress: Likes implemented
Quick test: Works!
Go to sleep.

Day 3 - Wednesday Morning (8 AM)
CHECKPOINT 2: Review likes feature (10 minutes)
You: "Likes work great! Actually, can we have..."
[You now know what you REALLY want based on using it]

Day 3 - Wednesday Evening (7 PM)
You: "Add user profiles with follow system"
Orchestrator: Plans 8-hour batch (larger, you're more certain now)

Day 4 - Thursday Morning (8 AM)
CHECKPOINT 3: Review profiles (25 minutes)
You: "This is production-ready!"

Result: 20 hours of implementation, 3 checkpoints, stakeholder thrilled
```

**Key differences**:
- ✅ Working software every day
- ✅ Adjusted priorities based on reality ("likes before profiles")
- ✅ Discovered real requirements through use
- ✅ No big "reveal" that disappoints
- ✅ Stakeholder stays engaged throughout

## Decision Framework: Before Each Batch

### Question 1: How Certain Are We?

**Very certain** (have detailed spec, mockups, clear vision):
- → Larger batch (8-12 hours)
- → Fewer checkpoints
- → Example: "Build profiles exactly like Twitter"

**Somewhat certain** (rough idea, general direction):
- → Medium batch (4-8 hours)
- → Regular checkpoints
- → Example: "Add comment system, figure out UX"

**Uncertain** (exploring, don't know what we want):
- → Small batch (2-4 hours)
- → Frequent checkpoints
- → Example: "Let's try a recommendation algorithm"

---

### Question 2: How Critical Is This?

**Critical/core feature** (authentication, payment, security):
- → Smaller batch (more oversight)
- → More checkpoints
- → Higher quality bar
- → Example: "Implement payment processing"

**Important but not critical** (nice features):
- → Medium batch
- → Standard checkpoints
- → Normal quality bar
- → Example: "Add dark mode"

**Nice-to-have** (experimental, optional):
- → Can be larger batch
- → Fewer checkpoints
- → Example: "Try adding animations"

---

### Question 3: How Complex Is This?

**High complexity** (many moving parts, integration):
- → Smaller batch (limit risk)
- → Break into smaller pieces
- → Example: "Real-time notifications system"

**Medium complexity** (standard feature):
- → Standard batch size
- → Example: "CRUD for resource"

**Low complexity** (simple, straightforward):
- → Can batch multiple together
- → Example: "Add timestamp to posts"

---

### Question 4: What's the Feedback Cycle?

**Fast feedback available** (stakeholder very engaged):
- → Smaller batches (take advantage!)
- → Rapid iteration
- → Example: Working with client daily

**Slow feedback** (stakeholder reviews weekly):
- → Larger batches (but risky!)
- → Make each batch count
- → Example: Client reviews Fridays only

**Async feedback** (email/async communication):
- → Medium batches
- → Self-contained deliverables
- → Example: Remote client, timezone differences

---

## Batch Size Formula

### The Formula

```typescript
function calculateOptimalBatchSize(
  baseBatchSize: number = 6, // 6 hours default
  factors: BatchFactors
): number {
  let size = baseBatchSize;

  // Certainty factor
  if (factors.certainty === 'exploration') size *= 0.5;   // 3 hours
  if (factors.certainty === 'refinement') size *= 1.0;    // 6 hours
  if (factors.certainty === 'execution') size *= 1.5;     // 9 hours

  // Complexity factor
  if (factors.complexity === 'high') size *= 0.75;        // ×0.75
  if (factors.complexity === 'medium') size *= 1.0;       // ×1.0
  if (factors.complexity === 'low') size *= 1.25;         // ×1.25

  // Risk factor
  if (factors.risk === 'high') size *= 0.75;              // ×0.75
  if (factors.risk === 'medium') size *= 1.0;             // ×1.0
  if (factors.risk === 'low') size *= 1.25;               // ×1.25

  // Criticality factor
  if (factors.critical) size *= 0.75;                     // Smaller for critical

  // Clamp to reasonable range
  return Math.min(Math.max(size, 2), 12);                 // 2-12 hours
}
```

---

### Example Calculations

**Example 1: Search Feature**
```typescript
const batch1 = calculateOptimalBatchSize(6, {
  certainty: 'refinement',     // We've done search before
  complexity: 'high',          // Search is complex
  risk: 'medium',              // Not core feature
  critical: false,
});
// Result: 6 × 1.0 × 0.75 × 1.0 = 4.5 hours
```

**Example 2: Payment Integration**
```typescript
const batch2 = calculateOptimalBatchSize(6, {
  certainty: 'execution',      // Clear requirements
  complexity: 'high',          // Payments are complex
  risk: 'high',                // Money involved!
  critical: true,              // Critical feature
});
// Result: 6 × 1.5 × 0.75 × 0.75 × 0.75 = 3.8 hours
```

**Example 3: Simple Profile Field**
```typescript
const batch3 = calculateOptimalBatchSize(6, {
  certainty: 'execution',      // Exact requirements
  complexity: 'low',           // Simple field addition
  risk: 'low',                 // Low risk
  critical: false,
});
// Result: 6 × 1.5 × 1.25 × 1.25 = 14.0 → clamped to 12 hours
```

## Measuring Success

### Green Flags (Good Batch Size) ✅

**After checkpoint, if you see these**:
- ✅ Human review takes 15-30 minutes
- ✅ 1-2 iterations max to approval
- ✅ Stakeholder says "This is great!"
- ✅ Can demo working feature end-to-end
- ✅ No architectural surprises
- ✅ Code quality is good
- ✅ Tests are passing
- ✅ Minor tweaks only

**Action**: This batch size is working! Continue.

---

### Red Flags (Batch Too Large) 🚩

**After checkpoint, if you see these**:
- 🚩 Human review takes >1 hour
- 🚩 Multiple rework cycles needed
- 🚩 Stakeholder says "This isn't what I meant"
- 🚩 Feature doesn't work end-to-end
- 🚩 Architectural problems discovered
- 🚩 Code quality issues throughout
- 🚩 Tests reveal fundamental problems
- 🚩 Major changes requested

**Action**: Reduce batch size for next sprint. Break work into smaller pieces.

---

### Yellow Flags (Batch Too Small) ⚠️

**After checkpoint, if you see these**:
- ⚠️ Feature feels incomplete
- ⚠️ Can't demo meaningful value
- ⚠️ Stakeholder says "Show me more"
- ⚠️ Review feels like waste of time
- ⚠️ Too much overhead for little progress

**Action**: Increase batch size for next sprint. Combine related work.

---

### Tracking Over Time

```typescript
interface BatchEffectiveness {
  sizeRange: string;
  attempts: number;
  successRate: number;
  avgReviewTime: number;
  reworkRate: number;
  humanSatisfaction: number;
}

const effectiveness: BatchEffectiveness[] = [
  {
    sizeRange: '2-4h',
    attempts: 8,
    successRate: 0.95,
    avgReviewTime: 15,
    reworkRate: 0.05,
    humanSatisfaction: 8.5,
  },
  {
    sizeRange: '4-6h',
    attempts: 12,
    successRate: 0.92,
    avgReviewTime: 25,
    reworkRate: 0.08,
    humanSatisfaction: 9.0,  // Sweet spot!
  },
  {
    sizeRange: '6-8h',
    attempts: 7,
    successRate: 0.88,
    avgReviewTime: 35,
    reworkRate: 0.12,
    humanSatisfaction: 8.2,
  },
  {
    sizeRange: '8-12h',
    attempts: 4,
    successRate: 0.75,
    avgReviewTime: 55,
    reworkRate: 0.25,
    humanSatisfaction: 7.0,  // Getting risky
  },
  {
    sizeRange: '12+h',
    attempts: 2,
    successRate: 0.60,
    avgReviewTime: 90,
    reworkRate: 0.40,
    humanSatisfaction: 6.0,  // Too large
  },
];
```

**Insight from data**: 4-6 hour batches have best combination of success rate and human satisfaction.

## Recommendations by Phase

### Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Test Orchestrator + Initial Features

**Batch size: 2-4 hours**

**Why?**
- You're learning how to use the system
- Orchestrator is learning project patterns
- High uncertainty
- Building confidence

**Example batches**:
- Test 1: Fix single bug (1-2 hours)
- Test 2: Fix 2-3 related bugs (3-4 hours)
- Feature 1: Simple feature (2-3 hours)

---

### Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Established Workflow

**Batch size: 4-6 hours**

**Why?**
- Patterns established
- Trust built
- More efficient
- Sweet spot discovered

**Example batches**:
- Feature: Complete user story (4-6 hours)
- Refactor: Improve existing feature (4-5 hours)
- Enhancement: Add 2-3 related capabilities (5-6 hours)

---

### Phase 3 (Months 7+): Mature Usage

**Batch size: 4-8 hours (adaptive)**

**Why?**
- Adjust based on context
- Use formula for each batch
- Data-driven decisions
- Optimize for each scenario

**Example batches**:
- Exploration: New feature type (3-4 hours)
- Refinement: Known patterns (6-7 hours)
- Execution: Clear specs (8-10 hours)

---

## The Bottom Line

### For Project Orchestrator MVP (Phase 1-2)

**Default**: 4-6 hour batches

**Checkpoint**: After each vertical slice (working feature)

**Human review**: 20-30 minutes per checkpoint

**Expectation**: Working feature, minor tweaks OK, no major rework

**Success metric**: Stakeholder satisfaction ≥ 8/10

---

### As You Gain Experience

1. **Track metrics** - Record batch size, review time, rework rate
2. **Find your sweet spot** - What works for YOUR projects?
3. **Adjust by context** - Different projects need different sizes
4. **Let data guide you** - Not guesswork, evidence-based

---

### The Key Insight

**Batch size should match confidence level, not project size.**

```
Low confidence → Small batches → Fast feedback → Learn → Increase size

High confidence → Larger batches → Efficient execution
```

**Progression**:
```
Start small (2-4 hours)
    ↓
Build confidence
    ↓
Increase to sweet spot (4-6 hours)
    ↓
Optimize based on context (4-8 hours adaptive)
```

## Test 4A Validation

**What happened in Test 4A**:
- Uncertain situation (didn't know what bugs existed)
- Small batches (each bug = 15-60 min)
- Checkpoint after each (tested in browser)
- Discovered next issue, repeated
- **Result**: 6 bugs fixed systematically in 3.83 hours

**This validates the approach**:
- ✅ Small batches work for uncertainty
- ✅ Checkpoints enable discovery
- ✅ Fast feedback enables learning
- ✅ Systematic progress despite unknowns

**Lesson**: Start with small batches. Let confidence guide growth.

## Practical Guidelines Summary

### Starting Out (First 5 Batches)

```
Batch 1: 2 hours  (very conservative)
Batch 2: 3 hours  (building confidence)
Batch 3: 4 hours  (if going well)
Batch 4: 5 hours  (if still going well)
Batch 5: 6 hours  (reached sweet spot)
```

**Then**: Adjust based on context using formula.

---

### Decision Checklist

**Before each batch, ask**:
- [ ] How certain are we about requirements?
- [ ] How complex is this work?
- [ ] How critical is this feature?
- [ ] What's our feedback cycle?
- [ ] What's our track record with similar work?

**Calculate**: Batch size using formula

**Sanity check**: Does this feel right?

**Execute**: Build the batch

**Review**: Track metrics, learn, adjust

---

### When in Doubt

**Default to 4-6 hours.**

This is the sweet spot for most scenarios:
- ✓ Meaningful progress
- ✓ Manageable review
- ✓ Low rework risk
- ✓ Fast feedback

**Only deviate when you have good reason.**

## Future Enhancements

### Adaptive Orchestrator (Future)

Eventually, the Orchestrator could:

```typescript
class AdaptiveOrchestrator {
  async planNextBatch(context: ProjectContext): Promise<BatchPlan> {
    // Analyze historical success
    const history = await this.getHistory();

    // Calculate optimal size
    const optimal = this.optimizer.recommend(context, history);

    // Generate plan
    return {
      batchSize: optimal.hours,
      reasoning: optimal.reasoning,
      confidence: optimal.confidence,
      riskAssessment: optimal.risks,
    };
  }
}
```

**Human just approves the plan** - Orchestrator learns optimal sizes.

---

### Smart Checkpoints (Future)

Orchestrator could suggest when to checkpoint:

```typescript
// During execution
if (this.detectsUncertainty() || this.architecturalDecisionNeeded()) {
  await this.escalate({
    reason: 'Architectural decision needed',
    question: 'Should we use REST or GraphQL for this API?',
    options: [/* analyzed options */],
  });
}
```

**Adaptive checkpoints** based on confidence level.

---

## Conclusion

**The answer to "how much work per batch?" is**:

**"It depends - match confidence level"**

- **Low confidence** (exploration) → 2-4 hours
- **Medium confidence** (refinement) → 4-6 hours
- **High confidence** (execution) → 6-9 hours

**Start conservative (4-6h), track metrics, optimize over time.**

**Most important**: Work in vertical slices, checkpoint frequently, let feedback guide the way.
