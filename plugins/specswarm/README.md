## Quick Start

### New Feature Development

```bash
# 1. Create specification
/specswarm:specify "Add user authentication with email/password"

# 2. Design implementation plan
/specswarm:plan

# 3. Generate task breakdown
/specswarm:tasks

# 4. Execute implementation with quality validation
/specswarm:implement
```

### Bug Fixing

```bash
# Regression-test-first bugfix workflow
/specswarm:bugfix "Bug 915: Login fails with special characters in password"
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Comprehensive codebase analysis
/specswarm:analyze-quality

# Metrics-driven refactoring

## Key Features

### Quality Validation (0-100 Points)

Automated quality scoring across 6 dimensions:

- **Unit Tests** (25 pts) - Proportional by pass rate
- **Code Coverage** (25 pts) - Proportional by coverage %
- **Integration Tests** (15 pts) - API/service testing
- **Browser Tests** (15 pts) - E2E user flows
- **Bundle Size** (20 pts) - Performance budgets ⭐ NEW
- **Visual Alignment** (15 pts) - Future

### Tech Stack Management

Prevents technology drift across features:

```yaml
# /memory/tech-stack.md
Core Technologies:
  - TypeScript 5.x
  - React Router v7
  - PostgreSQL 17.x

Prohibited:
  - ❌ Redux (use React Router loaders/actions)
  - ❌ Class components (use functional)
```

**95% drift prevention** through automatic validation at plan, task, and implementation phases.

### SSR Pattern Validation

Detects production failures before deployment:

- Hardcoded URLs in loaders/actions
- Relative URLs in SSR contexts
- Missing environment-aware patterns
- React Router v7 / Remix / Next.js support

### Multi-Framework Testing

Supports 11 test frameworks automatically:

- JavaScript: Vitest, Jest, Mocha, Jasmine
- Python: Pytest, unittest
- Go: go test
- Ruby: RSpec
- Java: JUnit
- And more...

### Chain Bug Detection ⭐ NEW

Prevents Bug 912→913 cascading failures:

- Compares test counts before/after
- Detects new SSR issues
- Checks TypeScript errors
- Stops cascading bugs

### Bundle Size Monitoring ⭐ NEW

Automatic performance tracking:

- Analyzes production bundles
- Calculates size score (0-20 points)
- Enforces configurable budgets
- Tracks over time

---

## Configuration

### Quality Standards

Enable quality gates by creating `/memory/quality-standards.md`:

```yaml
# Quality Gates
min_test_coverage: 85
min_quality_score: 80
block_merge_on_failure: false

# Performance Budgets (NEW in v2.0)
enforce_budgets: true
max_bundle_size: 500      # KB per bundle
max_initial_load: 1000    # KB initial load
```

### Tech Stack

Define your stack in `/memory/tech-stack.md`:

```markdown
## Core Technologies
- TypeScript 5.x
- React Router v7

## Approved Libraries
- Zod v4+ (validation)
- Drizzle ORM (database)

## Prohibited
- ❌ Redux (use React Router loaders/actions)
```

---

## Integration with SpecLabs

SpecSwarm can suggest experimental SpecLabs features when appropriate:

**Complex Bugs**:
```
/specswarm:bugfix detects chain bugs
→ "Use /speclabs:coordinate for systematic analysis?"
```

**Autonomous Mode**:
```
/specswarm:implement
→ "Try /speclabs:orchestrate-test for autonomous execution?"
```

See [SpecLabs](../speclabs/README.md) for experimental features.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Define tech-stack.md early** - Prevents drift from day 1
2. **Enable quality gates** - Maintain >80% scores
3. **Run analyze-quality regularly** - Catch issues early
4. **Keep bundles <500KB** - Performance matters
5. **Use bugfix workflow** - Regression testing prevents cascades

---

## Troubleshooting

### Quality Validation Not Running

Create `/memory/quality-standards.md` to enable quality gates.

### SSR Validation Fails

Use environment-aware helper:

```typescript
// app/utils/api.ts
export function getApiUrl(path: string): string {
  const base = typeof window !== 'undefined'
    ? ''
    : process.env.API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';
  return `${base}${path}`;
}
```

### Bundle Size Exceeds Budget

1. Implement code splitting
2. Use dynamic imports
3. Analyze: `npx vite-bundle-visualizer`
4. Remove unused dependencies
