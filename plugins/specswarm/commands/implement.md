## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Discover Feature Context**:

   **YOU MUST NOW discover the feature context using the Bash tool:**

   a. **Get repository root** by executing:
      ```bash
      git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd
      ```
      Store the result as REPO_ROOT.

   b. **Get current branch name** by executing:
      ```bash
      git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null
      ```
      Store the result as BRANCH.

   c. **Extract feature number from branch name** by executing:
      ```bash
      echo "$BRANCH" | grep -oE '^[0-9]{3}'
      ```
      Store the result as FEATURE_NUM.

   d. **If feature number is empty, find latest feature** by executing:
      ```bash
      ls -1 features/ 2>/dev/null | grep -oE '^[0-9]{3}' | sort -nr | head -1
      ```
      Store the result as FEATURE_NUM.

   e. **Find feature directory** by executing:
      ```bash
      find features -maxdepth 1 -type d -name "${FEATURE_NUM}-*" 2>/dev/null | head -1
      ```
      Combine with REPO_ROOT to get full path as FEATURE_DIR.

   f. **Display to user:**
      ```
      üìÅ Feature Context
      ‚úì Repository: {REPO_ROOT}
      ‚úì Branch: {BRANCH}
      ‚úì Feature: {FEATURE_NUM}
      ‚úì Directory: {FEATURE_DIR}
      ```

2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory
   - For each checklist, count:
     * Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     * Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     * Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`
   - Create a status table:
     ```
     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ‚úì PASS |
     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ‚úó FAIL |
     | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ‚úì PASS |
     ```
   - Calculate overall status:
     * **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items
     * **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items
   
   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:
     * Display the table with incomplete item counts
     * **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
     * Wait for user response before continuing
     * If user says "no" or "wait" or "stop", halt execution
     * If user says "yes" or "proceed" or "continue", proceed to step 3
   
   - **If all checklists are complete**:
     * Display the table showing all checklists passed
     * Automatically proceed to step 3

3. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read `/memory/tech-stack.md` for runtime validation (SpecSwarm)

<!-- ========== TECH STACK VALIDATION (SpecSwarm Enhancement) ========== -->
<!-- Added by Marty Bonacci & Claude Code (2025) -->

3b. **Pre-Implementation Tech Stack Validation** (if tech-stack.md exists):

   **Purpose**: Runtime validation before writing any code or imports

   **YOU MUST NOW perform tech stack validation using these steps:**

   1. **Check if tech-stack.md exists** using the Read tool:
      - Try to read `/memory/tech-stack.md`
      - If file doesn't exist: Skip this entire section (3b)
      - If file exists: Continue with validation

   2. **Load Tech Stack Compliance Report** from plan.md using the Read tool:
      - Read `${FEATURE_DIR}/plan.md`
      - Search for "Tech Stack Compliance Report" section
      - If section does NOT exist: Skip validation (plan created before SpecSwarm)
      - If section DOES exist: Continue to step 3

   3. **Verify All Conflicts Resolved** using the Grep tool:

      a. Search for conflicts:
         ```bash
         grep -q "‚ö†Ô∏è Conflicting Technologies" "${FEATURE_DIR}/plan.md"
         ```

      b. If conflicts found, check if unresolved:
         ```bash
         grep -q "**Your choice**: _\[" "${FEATURE_DIR}/plan.md"
         ```

      c. If unresolved choices found:
         - **HALT** implementation
         - Display error: "‚ùå Tech stack conflicts still unresolved"
         - Display message: "Cannot implement until all conflicts in plan.md are resolved"
         - Stop execution

   4. **Verify No Prohibited Technologies in Plan** using the Grep tool:

      a. Search for prohibited techs:
         ```bash
         grep -q "‚ùå Prohibited Technologies" "${FEATURE_DIR}/plan.md"
         ```

      b. If found, check if blocking:
         ```bash
         grep -q "**Cannot proceed**" "${FEATURE_DIR}/plan.md"
         ```

      c. If blocking issues found:
         - **HALT** implementation
         - Display error: "‚ùå Prohibited technologies still present in plan.md"
         - Display message: "Remove or replace prohibited technologies before implementing"
         - Stop execution

   4. **Load Prohibited Technologies List**:
      ```bash
      # Extract all prohibited technologies from tech-stack.md
      PROHIBITED_TECHS=()
      APPROVED_ALTERNATIVES=()

      while IFS= read -r line; do
        if [[ $line =~ ^-\ ‚ùå\ (.*)\ \(use\ (.*)\ instead\) ]]; then
          PROHIBITED_TECHS+=("${BASH_REMATCH[1]}")
          APPROVED_ALTERNATIVES+=("${BASH_REMATCH[2]}")
        fi
      done < <(grep "‚ùå" "${REPO_ROOT}/memory/tech-stack.md")
      ```

   5. **Runtime Import/Dependency Validation**:

      **BEFORE writing ANY file that contains imports or dependencies:**

      ```bash
      # For each import statement or dependency about to be written:
      check_technology_compliance() {
        local TECH_NAME="$1"
        local FILE_PATH="$2"
        local LINE_CONTENT="$3"

        # Check if technology is prohibited
        for i in "${!PROHIBITED_TECHS[@]}"; do
          PROHIBITED="${PROHIBITED_TECHS[$i]}"
          APPROVED="${APPROVED_ALTERNATIVES[$i]}"

          if echo "$TECH_NAME" | grep -qi "$PROHIBITED"; then
            ERROR "Prohibited technology detected: $PROHIBITED"
            MESSAGE "File: $FILE_PATH"
            MESSAGE "Line: $LINE_CONTENT"
            MESSAGE "‚ùå Cannot use: $PROHIBITED"
            MESSAGE "‚úÖ Must use: $APPROVED"
            MESSAGE "See /memory/tech-stack.md for details"
            HALT
          fi
        done

        # Check if technology is unapproved (warn but allow)
        if ! grep -qi "$TECH_NAME" "${REPO_ROOT}/memory/tech-stack.md" 2>/dev/null; then
          WARNING "Unapproved technology: $TECH_NAME"
          MESSAGE "File: $FILE_PATH"
          MESSAGE "This library is not in tech-stack.md"
          PROMPT "Continue anyway? (yes/no)"
          read -r RESPONSE
          if [[ ! "$RESPONSE" =~ ^[Yy] ]]; then
            MESSAGE "Halting. Please add $TECH_NAME to tech-stack.md or choose approved alternative"
            HALT
          fi
        fi
      }
      ```

   6. **Validation Triggers**:

      **JavaScript/TypeScript**:
      - Before writing: `import ... from '...'`
      - Before writing: `require('...')`
      - Before writing: `npm install ...` or `yarn add ...`
      - Extract library name and validate

      **Python**:
      - Before writing: `import ...` or `from ... import ...`
      - Before writing: `pip install ...`
      - Extract module name and validate

      **Go**:
      - Before writing: `import "..."`
      - Before executing: `go get ...`
      - Extract package name and validate

      **General**:
      - Before writing any `package.json` dependencies
      - Before writing any `requirements.txt` entries
      - Before writing any `go.mod` require statements
      - Before writing any `composer.json` dependencies

   7. **Pattern Validation**:

      Check for prohibited patterns (not just libraries):
      ```bash
      validate_code_pattern() {
        local FILE_CONTENT="$1"
        local FILE_PATH="$2"

        # Check for prohibited patterns from tech-stack.md
        # Example: "Class components" prohibited
        if echo "$FILE_CONTENT" | grep -q "class.*extends React.Component"; then
          ERROR "Prohibited pattern: Class components"
          MESSAGE "File: $FILE_PATH"
          MESSAGE "Use functional components instead"
          HALT
        fi

        # Example: "Redux" prohibited
        if echo "$FILE_CONTENT" | grep -qi "createStore\|configureStore.*@reduxjs"; then
          ERROR "Prohibited library: Redux"
          MESSAGE "File: $FILE_PATH"
          MESSAGE "Use React Router loaders/actions instead"
          HALT
        fi
      }
      ```

   8. **Continuous Validation**:
      - Run validation before EVERY file write operation
      - Run validation before EVERY package manager command
      - Run validation before EVERY import statement
      - Accumulate violations and report at end if in batch mode

<!-- ========== END TECH STACK VALIDATION ========== -->

4. **Project Setup Verification**:
   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:
   
   **Detection & Creation Logic**:
   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):

     ```sh
     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
     ```
   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md ‚Üí create/verify .dockerignore
   - Check if .eslintrc* or eslint.config.* exists ‚Üí create/verify .eslintignore
   - Check if .prettierrc* exists ‚Üí create/verify .prettierignore
   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists ‚Üí create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)
   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist ‚Üí create/verify .terraformignore
   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) ‚Üí create/verify .helmignore
   
   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only
   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology
   
   **Common Patterns by Technology** (from plan.md tech stack):
   - **Node.js/JavaScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **Python**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`
   - **Java**: `target/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `.gradle/`, `build/`
   - **C#/.NET**: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `packages/`
   - **Go**: `*.exe`, `*.test`, `vendor/`, `*.out`
   - **Universal**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`
   
   **Tool-Specific Patterns**:
   - **Docker**: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `Dockerfile*`, `.dockerignore`, `*.log*`, `.env*`, `coverage/`
   - **ESLint**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `*.min.js`
   - **Prettier**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
   - **Terraform**: `.terraform/`, `*.tfstate*`, `*.tfvars`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`

5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

6. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

7. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

8. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

9. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
   - Report final status with summary of completed work

<!-- ========== QUALITY VALIDATION (SpecSwarm Phase 1) ========== -->
<!-- Added by Marty Bonacci & Claude Code (2025) -->

10. **Quality Validation** - CRITICAL STEP, MUST EXECUTE:

   **Purpose**: Automated quality assurance before merge

   **YOU MUST NOW CHECK FOR AND RUN QUALITY VALIDATION:**

   1. **First**, check if quality standards file exists by reading the file at `${REPO_ROOT}/memory/quality-standards.md` using the Read tool.

   2. **If the file does NOT exist:**
      - Display this message to the user:
        ```
        ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Quality Validation
        ====================

        No quality standards defined. Skipping automated validation.

        To enable quality gates:
          1. Create /memory/quality-standards.md
          2. Define minimum coverage and quality score
          3. Configure test requirements

        See: plugins/specswarm/templates/quality-standards-template.md
        ```
      - Then proceed directly to Step 11 (Git Workflow)

   3. **If the file EXISTS, you MUST execute the full quality validation workflow using the Bash tool:**

      a. **Display header** by outputting directly to the user:
         ```
         üß™ Running Quality Validation
         =============================
         ```

      b. **Detect test frameworks** by running these Bash commands:
         ```bash
         cd ${REPO_ROOT} && source ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/specswarm-marketplace/plugins/specswarm/lib/quality-gates.sh && detect_test_framework
         ```
         Store the result in a variable for use in the report.

      c. **Run unit tests** using the Bash tool:
         ```bash
         cd ${REPO_ROOT} && npx vitest run --reporter=verbose 2>&1 | tail -50
         ```
         Parse the output to extract:
         - Total tests run
         - Tests passed
         - Tests failed
         - Test duration
         Display results to the user with "1. Unit Tests" header.

      d. **Measure code coverage** (if coverage tool available):
         - Check if `@vitest/coverage-v8` or similar is installed
         - If yes, run: `npx vitest run --coverage --reporter=verbose 2>&1 | grep -A 10 "Coverage"`
         - Parse coverage percentage
         - Display results to user with "3. Code Coverage" header
         - If no coverage tool, display "Coverage measurement not configured" and use 0%

      e. **Detect browser test framework**:
         ```bash
         cd ${REPO_ROOT} && source ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/specswarm-marketplace/plugins/specswarm/lib/quality-gates.sh && detect_browser_test_framework
         ```

      f. **Run browser tests** (if Playwright/Cypress detected):
         - For Playwright: `npx playwright test 2>&1 | tail -30`
         - For Cypress: `npx cypress run 2>&1 | tail -30`
         - Parse results (passed/failed/total)
         - Display with "4. Browser Tests" header
         - If no browser framework: Display "No browser test framework detected - Skipping"

      g. **Calculate quality score** based on these components:
         - Unit Tests: 25 points if all pass, 0 if any fail
         - Integration Tests: 20 points if all pass, 0 if any fail
         - Coverage: 25 points * (coverage_pct / min_coverage_target)
         - Browser Tests: 15 points if all pass, 0 if fail, skip if not available
         - Visual Alignment: 15 points (set to 0 for now - screenshot analysis Phase 2)

         Total possible: 100 points

      h. **Display quality report** to the user:
         ```
         Quality Validation Results
         ==========================

         ‚úì/‚úó Unit Tests: X passing, Y failing
         ‚úì/‚úó Code Coverage: Z% (target: A%)
         ‚úì/‚úó Browser Tests: X passing, Y failing (or "Not configured")
         ‚äò Visual Alignment: Phase 2 feature (not yet implemented)

         Quality Score: XX/100
         Status: PASSED/FAILED (threshold: YY)
         ```

      i. **Check quality gates** from quality-standards.md:
         - Read min_quality_score (default 80)
         - Read block_merge_on_failure (default false)
         - If score < minimum:
           - If block_merge_on_failure is true: HALT and show error
           - If block_merge_on_failure is false: Show warning and ask user "Continue with merge anyway? (yes/no)"
         - If score >= minimum: Display "‚úÖ Quality validation passed!"

      j. **Save quality metrics** by updating `${REPO_ROOT}/memory/metrics.json`:
         - Add entry for current feature number
         - Include quality score, coverage, test results
         - Use Write tool to update the JSON file

   **IMPORTANT**: You MUST execute this step if quality-standards.md exists. Do NOT skip it. Use the Bash tool to run all commands and parse the results.

   4. **Proactive Quality Improvements** - If quality score < 80/100:

      **YOU MUST NOW offer to improve the quality score:**

      a. **Check for missing coverage tool:**
         - If Vitest was detected but coverage measurement showed 0% or "not configured":
           - Display to user:
             ```
             ‚ö° Coverage Tool Not Installed
             =============================

             Installing @vitest/coverage-v8 would add +25 points to your quality score.

             Current: {CURRENT_SCORE}/100
             With coverage: {CURRENT_SCORE + 25}/100

             Would you like me to:
             1. Install coverage tool and re-run validation
             2. Skip (continue without coverage)

             Choose (1 or 2):
             ```
           - If user chooses 1:
             - Run: `npm install --save-dev @vitest/coverage-v8`
             - Check if vitest.config.ts exists using Read tool
             - If exists, update it to add coverage configuration
             - If not exists, create vitest.config.ts with coverage config
             - Re-run quality validation (step 3 above)
             - Display new score

      b. **Check for missing E2E tests:**
         - If Playwright was detected but no tests were found:
           - Display to user:
             ```
             ‚ö° No E2E Tests Found
             =====================

             Writing basic E2E tests would add +15 points to your quality score.

             Current: {CURRENT_SCORE}/100
             With E2E tests: {CURRENT_SCORE + 15}/100

             Would you like me to:
             1. Generate basic Playwright test templates
             2. Skip (continue without E2E tests)

             Choose (1 or 2):
             ```
           - If user chooses 1:
             - Create tests/e2e/ directory if not exists
             - Generate basic test file with:
               * Login flow test (if authentication exists)
               * Main feature flow test (based on spec.md)
               * Basic smoke test
             - Run: `npx playwright test`
             - Re-run quality validation
             - Display new score

      c. **Display final improvement summary:**
         ```
         üìä Quality Score Improvement
         ============================

         Before improvements: {ORIGINAL_SCORE}/100
         After improvements:  {FINAL_SCORE}/100
         Increase: +{INCREASE} points

         {STATUS_EMOJI} Quality Status: {PASS/FAIL}
         ```

   **Note**: This proactive improvement step can increase quality scores from 25/100 to 65/100+ automatically.

<!-- ========== END QUALITY VALIDATION ========== -->

11. **Git Workflow Completion** (if git repository):

   **Purpose**: Handle feature branch merge and cleanup after successful implementation

   **INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE:**

   1. **Check if in a git repository** using Bash tool:
      ```bash
      git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
      ```
      If this fails, skip git workflow entirely.

   2. **Get current and main branch names** using Bash:
      ```bash
      git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
      git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@'
      ```

   3. **Only proceed if on a feature branch** (not main/master). If already on main, display "Already on main branch" and stop.

   4. **Display git workflow options** to the user:
      ```
      üå≥ Git Workflow
      ===============

      Current branch: {CURRENT_BRANCH}
      Main branch: {MAIN_BRANCH}

      Feature implementation complete! What would you like to do?

        1. Merge to {MAIN_BRANCH} and delete feature branch (recommended)
        2. Stay on {CURRENT_BRANCH} for additional work
        3. Switch to {MAIN_BRANCH} without merging (keep branch)

      Choose (1/2/3):
      ```

   5. **Wait for user choice** and proceed based on their selection.

   **OPTION 1: Merge and Delete Branch**

   a. **Check for uncommitted changes** using Bash:
      ```bash
      git diff-index --quiet HEAD --
      ```
      If exit code is non-zero, there are uncommitted changes.

   b. **If there are uncommitted changes:**
      - Display: `git status --short` to show changes
      - Ask user: "Commit these changes first? (yes/no)"

   c. **If user wants to commit, intelligently stage ONLY source files:**

      **CRITICAL - Smart Git Staging (to avoid build artifacts):**

      1. **Get list of all changed files:**
         ```bash
         git status --porcelain
         ```

      2. **Filter out build artifacts** - Exclude files matching these patterns:
         - `build/`, `dist/`, `.next/`, `out/`
         - `node_modules/`, `.pnpm-store/`, `.yarn/`
         - `*.log`, `.env*` (unless explicitly in repo)
         - `coverage/`, `.nyc_output/`
         - `*.min.js`, `*.map`
         - Anything matching patterns in .gitignore

      3. **Stage ONLY filtered files** using specific paths:
         ```bash
         # For each file from filtered list:
         git add {specific-file-path}
         ```

         OR use git's pathspec feature to exclude patterns:
         ```bash
         git add . ':!build/' ':!dist/' ':!.next/' ':!out/' ':!coverage/' ':!*.log'
         ```

      4. **Commit with user-provided message** using Bash:
         ```bash
         git commit -m "{USER_PROVIDED_MESSAGE}"
         ```

   d. **Merge to main branch:**
      - Test merge first (dry run): `git merge --no-commit --no-ff {CURRENT_BRANCH}`
      - If successful: abort test, do real merge with message
      - If conflicts: abort, show manual resolution steps, stay on feature branch

   e. **Delete feature branch** if merge succeeded:
      ```bash
      git branch -d {CURRENT_BRANCH}
      ```

   **OPTION 2: Stay on Current Branch**
   - Display message about when/how to merge later
   - No git commands needed

   **OPTION 3: Switch to Main (Keep Branch)**
   - Switch to main: `git checkout {MAIN_BRANCH}`
   - Keep feature branch for later

   **IMPORTANT**: When staging files for commit, NEVER use `git add .` - always filter out build artifacts!

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/tasks` first to regenerate the task list.
