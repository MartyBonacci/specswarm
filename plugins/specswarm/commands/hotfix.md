```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Goal

Execute expedited emergency response workflow for critical production issues requiring immediate resolution.

**Key Principles**:
1. **Speed First**: Minimal process overhead, maximum velocity
2. **Safety**: Despite speed, maintain essential safeguards
3. **Rollback Ready**: Always have rollback plan
4. **Post-Mortem**: After fire is out, analyze and learn
5. **Communication**: Keep stakeholders informed

**Use Cases**: Critical bugs, security vulnerabilities, data corruption, service outages

**Coverage**: Addresses ~10-15% of development work (emergencies)

---

## Smart Integration Detection

```bash
# Check for SpecSwarm (tech stack enforcement) - OPTIONAL in hotfix
SPECSWARM_INSTALLED=$(claude plugin list | grep -q "specswarm" && echo "true" || echo "false")

# Check for SpecTest (parallel execution, hooks, metrics)
SPECTEST_INSTALLED=$(claude plugin list | grep -q "spectest" && echo "true" || echo "false")

# In hotfix mode, integration is OPTIONAL - speed is priority
if [ "$SPECTEST_INSTALLED" = "true" ]; then
  ENABLE_METRICS=true
  echo "🎯 SpecTest detected (metrics enabled, but minimal overhead)"
fi

if [ "$SPECSWARM_INSTALLED" = "true" ]; then
  TECH_VALIDATION_AVAILABLE=true
  echo "🎯 SpecSwarm detected (tech validation available if time permits)"
fi
```

**Note**: In hotfix mode, speed takes precedence. Tech validation and hooks are OPTIONAL.

---

## Pre-Workflow Hook (if SpecTest installed)

```bash
if [ "$ENABLE_METRICS" = "true" ]; then
  echo "🎣 Pre-Hotfix Hook (minimal overhead mode)"
  WORKFLOW_START_TIME=$(date +%s)
  echo "✓ Emergency metrics tracking initialized"
  echo ""
fi
```

---

## Execution Steps

### 1. Discover Hotfix Context

```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)

# Try to extract hotfix number from branch (hotfix/NNN-*)
HOTFIX_NUM=$(echo "$CURRENT_BRANCH" | grep -oE 'hotfix/([0-9]{3})' | grep -oE '[0-9]{3}')

if [ -z "$HOTFIX_NUM" ]; then
  echo "🚨 HOTFIX WORKFLOW - EMERGENCY MODE"
  echo ""
  echo "No hotfix branch detected. Provide hotfix number:"
  read -p "Hotfix number: " HOTFIX_NUM
  HOTFIX_NUM=$(printf "%03d" $HOTFIX_NUM)
fi

FEATURE_DIR="${REPO_ROOT}/features/${HOTFIX_NUM}-hotfix"
mkdir -p "$FEATURE_DIR"

HOTFIX_SPEC="${FEATURE_DIR}/hotfix.md"
TASKS_FILE="${FEATURE_DIR}/tasks.md"
```

Output:
```
🚨 Hotfix Workflow - EMERGENCY MODE - Hotfix ${HOTFIX_NUM}
✓ Branch: ${CURRENT_BRANCH}
✓ Feature directory: ${FEATURE_DIR}
⚡ Expedited process active (minimal overhead)
```

---

### 2. Create Minimal Hotfix Specification

Create `$HOTFIX_SPEC` with ESSENTIAL details only:

```markdown
# Hotfix ${HOTFIX_NUM}: [Title]

**🚨 EMERGENCY**: [Critical/High Priority]
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Status**: Active

---

## Emergency Summary

**What's Broken**: [Brief description]

**Impact**:
- Users affected: [scope]
- Service status: [degraded/down]

## Post-Workflow Hook (if SpecTest installed)

```bash
if [ "$ENABLE_METRICS" = "true" ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "🎣 Post-Hotfix Hook"

  WORKFLOW_END_TIME=$(date +%s)
  WORKFLOW_DURATION=$((WORKFLOW_END_TIME - WORKFLOW_START_TIME))
  WORKFLOW_MINUTES=$(echo "scale=0; $WORKFLOW_DURATION / 60" | bc)

  echo "✓ Emergency resolved"
  echo "⏱️  Time to Resolution: ${WORKFLOW_MINUTES} minutes"

  # Update metrics
  METRICS_FILE="/memory/workflow-metrics.json"
  echo "📊 Emergency metrics saved: ${METRICS_FILE}"

  echo ""
  echo "📋 Post-Emergency Actions:"
  echo "- Complete T005-T007 in normal hours"
  echo "- Schedule post-mortem"
  echo "- Document learnings"
fi
```

---

## Final Output

```
✅ Hotfix Workflow Complete - Hotfix ${HOTFIX_NUM}

🚨 Emergency Status: RESOLVED

📋 Artifacts Created:
- ${HOTFIX_SPEC}
- ${TASKS_FILE}

📊 Results:
- Emergency resolved in: ${RESOLUTION_TIME}
- Service status: Restored
- Rollback triggered: [Yes/No]

⏱️  Time to Resolution: ${WORKFLOW_DURATION}

📋 Post-Emergency Actions Required:
1. Root cause analysis (T005) - within 24-48h
2. Permanent fix (T006) - if hotfix is temporary
3. Post-mortem (T007) - within 1 week

📈 Next Steps:
- Monitor production metrics closely
- Schedule post-mortem meeting
- Plan permanent fix: /speclab:bugfix (if hotfix is temporary)
```

---

## Error Handling

**If hotfix fails**:
- Execute rollback plan immediately
- Escalate to senior engineer
- Document failure for post-mortem

**If rollback fails**:
- CRITICAL: Manual intervention required
- Alert on-call engineer
- Document all actions taken

**If emergency worsens**:
- Stop hotfix attempt
- Consider service shutdown / maintenance mode
- Escalate to incident commander

---

## Operating Principles

1. **Speed Over Process**: Minimize overhead, maximize velocity
2. **Essential Only**: Skip non-critical validations
3. **Rollback Ready**: Always have escape hatch
4. **Monitor Closely**: Watch post-deployment metrics
5. **Learn After**: Post-mortem is mandatory
6. **Communicate**: Keep stakeholders informed
7. **Temporary OK**: Hotfix can be temporary (permanent fix later)

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Emergency resolved quickly (<2 hours)
✅ Service restored to normal operation
✅ No data loss or corruption
✅ Rollback plan tested (if needed)
✅ Post-emergency tasks scheduled
✅ Incident documented for learning

---

**Workflow Coverage**: Addresses ~10-15% of development work (emergencies)
**Speed**: ~45-90 minutes average time to resolution
**Integration**: Optional SpecSwarm/SpecTest (speed takes priority)
**Graduation Path**: Proven workflow will graduate to SpecSwarm stable
