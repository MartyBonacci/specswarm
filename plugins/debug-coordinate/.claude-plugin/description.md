Systematic debugging coordination with logging, monitoring, and agent orchestration.

Manages complex debugging workflows by:
- Adding strategic logging across codebase
- Monitoring server/build output in real-time
- Correlating log patterns with code changes
- Identifying root causes from analysis
- Spawning specialist agents per domain
- Coordinating parallel fixes

Use when debugging involves multiple bugs, domains, or requires extensive logging.
