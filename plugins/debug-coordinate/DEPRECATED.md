# ⚠️ DEPRECATED: debug-coordinate Plugin

**Status**: Deprecated as of 2025-10-15
**Merged Into**: **SpecLabs v1.0.0**

---

## Why Deprecated?

debug-coordinate has been consolidated with project-orchestrator into **SpecLabs**, creating a unified experimental plugin for autonomous development and advanced debugging.

**New Vision**: One experimental plugin for cutting-edge features while keeping SpecSwarm stable and production-ready.

---

## Migration Path

**The debug-coordinate command is now available in SpecLabs:**

| debug-coordinate Command | SpecLabs Equivalent | Notes |
|-------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| `/debug-coordinate:coordinate` | `/speclabs:coordinate` | Identical - systematic multi-bug debugging |

**To migrate**: Replace `/debug-coordinate:` with `/speclabs:` in your workflows.

---

## What's in SpecLabs?

**Complete Experimental Toolkit**:

**Advanced Debugging**:
- `/speclabs:coordinate` - Systematic multi-bug debugging with logging, monitoring, and multi-agent orchestration

**Autonomous Development**:
- `/speclabs:orchestrate-test` - Automated test workflow with agent execution
- `/speclabs:orchestrate-validate` - Validation suite (browser, terminal, visual analysis)

**All sharing**: Experimental infrastructure for autonomous workflows and advanced debugging

---

## Why Consolidate?

✅ **Clear separation** - SpecSwarm (stable) vs. SpecLabs (experimental)
✅ **Natural pairing** - Debugging and orchestration work together
✅ **Development synergy** - Use coordinate while building orchestrator
✅ **Simpler landscape** - 2 plugins instead of 4
✅ **Shared evolution** - Experimental features mature together

---

## Timeline

- **2025-10-15**: debug-coordinate merged into SpecLabs v1.0.0
- **debug-coordinate will not receive updates** - Use SpecLabs instead
- **No removal planned** - debug-coordinate remains available for legacy projects
