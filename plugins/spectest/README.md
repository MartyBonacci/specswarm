# SpecTest Plugin for Claude Code

**⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL** - Enhanced version of SpecSwarm with Phase 1 improvements

## What is SpecTest?

SpecTest is an experimental fork of SpecSwarm that implements high-impact workflow enhancements identified through comparative analysis with Agent OS, Claude-Flow, and wshobson/agents.

**Base**: SpecSwarm 1.0.0 (Spec-Driven Development + Tech Stack Management)
**Enhancements**: Parallel execution, hooks system, performance metrics

## 🆕 What's New in SpecTest?

### 1. **Parallel Task Execution** 🚀
**Problem**: Tasks with `[P]` markers executed sequentially
**Solution**: Batch parallel tasks and execute simultaneously

**Performance Impact**: **2-4x faster** implementation phase

**How it Works**:
- Detects all `[P]` tasks within each phase
- Groups independent tasks together
- Executes using single message with multiple Task tool calls
- Reports parallel execution statistics

**Example**:
```markdown
Phase 2: Core Implementation
- T005: [P] Create user model (app/models/user.ts)
- T006: [P] Create product model (app/models/product.ts)
- T007: [P] Create order model (app/models/order.ts)
```
**Before**: 15 min (5 min × 3 tasks sequentially)
**After**: 5 min (all 3 tasks in parallel)

---

### 2. **Pre/Post Operation Hooks** 🎣
**Problem**: No extensibility points for automation
**Solution**: Structured hook system at each workflow phase

**Hook Points**:
- `pre_specify`: Gather context, check prerequisites
- `post_specify`: Quality validation, auto-clarification
- `pre_plan`: Tech stack pre-validation, research prep
- `post_plan`: Consistency checks, contract generation
- `pre_tasks`: Dependency analysis, parallel detection
- `post_tasks`: Coverage validation, sequencing checks
- `pre_implement`: Environment setup, metrics initialization
- `post_implement`: Testing, metrics reporting

**Benefits**:
- Automated quality gates
- Better error prevention
- Extensibility for custom workflows
- Consistent validation across features

**Example Hook Output**:
```
🎣 Pre-Specify Hook
✓ Repository detected: Git
✓ Tech stack file exists: /memory/tech-stack.md
✓ Constitution found: /memory/constitution.md
✓ Ready to specify feature

[... specify command execution ...]

🎣 Post-Specify Hook
✓ Spec quality score: 95/100
✓ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
✓ All mandatory sections complete
⚡ Next step: Run /spectest:plan
```

---

### 3. **Performance Metrics & Analytics** 📊
**Problem**: No visibility into workflow bottlenecks
**Solution**: Comprehensive metrics tracking and dashboard

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Time per phase (specify, plan, tasks, implement)
- Quality scores (spec completeness, plan coverage)
- Tech stack violations (caught at plan vs runtime)
- Rework cycles (iterations per phase)
- Parallel execution efficiency
- Success rates per feature

**New Command**: `/spectest:metrics [feature-number]`

**Dashboard Output**:
```

## 🎯 Commands

All commands are identical to SpecSwarm, just use `/spectest:` prefix:

### ✅ Phase 1 Complete (Core Workflow with Hooks)

| Command | Description | Enhancements |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| `/spectest:specify <desc>` | Create feature spec | ✅ **Pre/post hooks**, quality validation, metrics |
| `/spectest:plan` | Technical planning | ✅ **Pre/post hooks**, tech stack summary, metrics |
| `/spectest:tasks` | Generate task breakdown | ✅ **Pre/post hooks**, parallel detection, execution preview |
| `/spectest:implement` | **Execute with parallel** | ✅ **Pre/post hooks**, **parallel batching**, metrics |
| `/spectest:metrics [feature]` | **📊 Performance dashboard** | ✅ **NEW command** - full analytics |

### ⏳ Phase 2 Planned (Supporting Commands)

These commands are **functional copies from SpecSwarm** - they work perfectly with all tech stack features, just without hooks yet.

| Command | Description | Current Status |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `/spectest:constitution` | Set project principles | ✅ Copy from SpecSwarm. Hooks planned for Phase 2. |
| `/spectest:clarify` | Resolve ambiguities | ✅ Copy from SpecSwarm. Hooks planned for Phase 2. |
| `/spectest:analyze` | Consistency validation | ✅ Copy from SpecSwarm. Hooks planned for Phase 2. |
| `/spectest:checklist <type>` | Quality checklists | ✅ Copy from SpecSwarm. Hooks planned for Phase 2. |

**What This Means:**
- ✅ All SpecSwarm functionality present (including tech stack enforcement)
- ✅ Commands work immediately, no limitations
- ⏳ Hooks will add automation when implemented in Phase 2

### Implementation Notes

**✅ Phase 1 Commands** provide the complete enhanced workflow:
- Pre/post hooks for automatic validation
- Performance metrics tracking
- Parallel execution (implement only)
- Intelligent next-step suggestions

**⏳ Phase 2 Commands** are copies from SpecSwarm:
- Exact same files as SpecSwarm plugin
- All tech stack enforcement features present
- All functionality stable and tested
- Hooks will add automation when implemented in Phase 2
- Can be used immediately without any limitations

**Complete Workflow**: Use Phase 1 commands (`specify` → `plan` → `tasks` → `implement` → `metrics`) for full enhanced experience with hooks and parallel execution.

## 🔬 Implementation Details

### Parallel Execution Algorithm
```markdown
1. Parse tasks.md and identify all [P] marked tasks
2. Group tasks by phase
3. Within each phase, group consecutive [P] tasks
4. For each parallel group:
   a. Verify no file conflicts (same file = sequential)
   b. Generate Task tool calls for each task
   c. Execute all in single message
   d. Wait for all completions
   e. Aggregate results
5. Continue to next group
```

### Hook Execution Flow
```markdown
Pre-Hook:
  → Load context
  → Validate prerequisites
  → Initialize metrics timer

Main Command:
  → Execute command logic
  → Track operations

Post-Hook:
  → Validate output quality
  → Update metrics
  → Suggest next steps
  → Save to /memory/metrics.json
```

### Metrics Storage
```json
{
  "features": {
    "001-user-authentication": {
      "phases": {
        "specify": {
          "duration_seconds": 45,
          "iterations": 1,
          "quality_score": 0.95,
          "timestamp": "2025-10-11T10:30:00Z"
        },
        "implement": {
          "duration_seconds": 375,
          "parallel_batches": 3,
          "tasks_executed": 24,
          "violations": 0,
          "speedup_factor": 2.9
        }
      },
      "total_duration": 375,
      "status": "completed"
    }
  }
}
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### Feature Scope Sizing

**Optimal Scope**: Target **8-12 hours of implementation work** per feature

**Why?**
- Fits comfortably in a single Claude Code session
- Allows for parallel execution benefits
- Maintains context and momentum
- Enables proper testing and validation

**If Scope is Too Large (>15 hours or >40 tasks):**

1. **Accept MVP Approach**: Implement core functionality first (e.g., "Phase 1-3 only")
2. **Split the Feature**: Break into multiple smaller features
3. **Document the Decision**: Note in project documentation
4. **Create Follow-up Features**: Plan additional features for remaining functionality

**Example**:
```
Original: "Complete authentication system" (42 tasks, 18-24h)
MVP: "User signup flow" (Phase 1-3, ~7-9h)
Follow-up: "User signin and session management" (Phase 4-5, ~8-10h)
Follow-up: "Password reset and account recovery" (Phase 6, ~4-6h)
```

### Parallel Task Marking

**Guidelines for [P] markers in tasks.md:**

✅ **Mark as [P] (Parallel)**:
- Independent model/schema files
- Separate UI components
- Non-overlapping test files
- Independent API endpoints

❌ **Keep Sequential**:
- Setup/configuration tasks
- Tasks with file dependencies
- Tasks requiring previous outputs
- Integration/wiring tasks

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Experimental Status**: This is alpha software, bugs expected
2. **Parallel Safety**: Relies on correct `[P]` marking in tasks.md
3. **Metrics Storage**: Uses simple JSON file (not persistent DB yet)
4. **Hook Extensibility**: Hooks are embedded in commands (not pluggable yet)

---

## 🔄 Migration Path

### From SpecSwarm → SpecTest
1. Install SpecTest plugin
2. Use `/spectest:*` commands on new features
3. Compare results with `/spectest:metrics`
4. If satisfied, exclusively use SpecTest

### From SpecTest → SpecSwarm
1. Uninstall SpecTest plugin
2. Continue using `/specswarm:*` commands
3. No data loss (uses same `/memory/` structure)
