## Commands (3)

### ü§ñ Autonomous Development

#### `/speclabs:orchestrate-test`
**Automated test workflow with agent execution and validation**

Execute autonomous development tasks using multi-agent coordination.

**Usage**:
```bash
/speclabs:orchestrate-test <test-workflow-file> <project-path>
```

**Example**:
```bash
/speclabs:orchestrate-test features/001-fix-bug/test-workflow.md /home/marty/code-projects/my-app
```

**What it does**:
1. Parses test workflow specification
2. Generates comprehensive agent prompt
3. Launches autonomous agent in target project
4. Agent executes task independently
5. Validation suite ready for verification

**Test Workflow Format**:
```markdown
# Test: [Task Name]

## Description
[What needs to be done]

## Files to Modify
- path/to/file1.ts
- path/to/file2.ts

## Changes Required
[Detailed description of changes]

## Expected Outcome
[What should happen after changes]

## Validation
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
```

**Phase 0 Limitations**:
- Single task execution only
- Basic error handling
- Manual validation required
- No retry logic yet

---

#### `/speclabs:orchestrate-validate`
**Comprehensive validation suite (browser, terminal, visual analysis)**

Run automated validation on target projects using Playwright browser automation.

**Usage**:
```bash
/speclabs:orchestrate-validate <project-path> [url]
```

**Examples**:
```bash
# Default URL (http://localhost:5173)
/speclabs:orchestrate-validate /home/marty/code-projects/my-app

# Custom URL
/speclabs:orchestrate-validate /home/marty/code-projects/my-app http://localhost:3000
```

**What it does**:
1. Checks dev server is running
2. Launches Playwright browser automation
3. Navigates to app and waits for load
4. Captures console errors
5. Captures network errors (4xx/5xx responses)
6. Takes full-page screenshot
7. Exports results as JSON
8. Generates validation report

**Validation Output**:
- **Results JSON**: `/tmp/orchestrator-validation-results.json`
- **Screenshot**: `/tmp/orchestrator-validation-screenshot.png`

**Phase 0 Limitations**:
- Manual visual analysis (use Read tool on screenshot)
- Single URL validation only
- No multi-step user flows yet
- Basic error detection

---

### üêõ Advanced Debugging

#### `/speclabs:coordinate`
**Systematic multi-bug debugging with logging, monitoring, and orchestration**

Transform chaotic debugging into systematic investigation with clear orchestration opportunities.

**Usage**:
```bash
/speclabs:coordinate "<problem-description>"
```

**Example**:
```bash
/speclabs:coordinate "navbar not updating after sign-in, sign-out not working, like button causes blank page"
```

**What it does**:

**Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis**
- Parses problem description into individual issues
- Creates debug session directory (`.debug-sessions/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`)
- Determines strategy (sequential vs orchestrated)
- Orchestrated recommended for 3+ bugs

**Phase 2: Logging Strategy**
- Generates logging strategy template
- Identifies suspected files/components
- Specifies strategic logging points
- Defines monitoring approach

**Phase 3: Monitor & Analyze**
- Guides application run and log capture
- Provides analysis template
- Helps identify root causes per issue
- Documents evidence and findings

**Phase 4: Orchestration Planning** (if 3+ bugs)
- Generates multi-agent orchestration plan
- Groups issues by domain
- Assigns agents to parallel tracks
- Defines coordination points

**Phase 5: Integration & Verification**
- Verification checklist
- Regression testing guidance
- Cleanup recommendations
- Learnings documentation

**Artifacts Created**:
```
.debug-sessions/20251015-143022/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ problem-description.md     # Issue breakdown
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logging-strategy.md        # Where to add logs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analysis-template.md       # Root cause findings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestration-plan.md      # Agent coordination (if 3+ bugs)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ verification-checklist.md  # Post-fix validation
```

**Design Philosophy**:
1. **Systematic Over Random** - Structured phases prevent random debugging
2. **Logging First** - Add instrumentation before making changes
3. **Parallel When Possible** - 3+ bugs ‚Üí orchestrate for efficiency
4. **Document Everything** - Create audit trail for learnings
5. **Verify Thoroughly** - Checklists ensure nothing missed

## Integration with SpecSwarm

SpecSwarm can suggest SpecLabs features when appropriate:

### Complex Bugs
```bash
# When bugfix detects chain bugs
/specswarm:bugfix "Multiple related issues found"
‚Üí Suggestion: "Consider /speclabs:coordinate for systematic multi-bug analysis"
```

### Autonomous Mode
```bash
# When implementing large features
/specswarm:implement
‚Üí Suggestion: "Try /speclabs:orchestrate-test for autonomous execution"
```

**Workflow Pattern**:
```
SpecSwarm (specify ‚Üí plan ‚Üí tasks)
    ‚Üì
SpecLabs (orchestrate-test) - Autonomous execution
    ‚Üì
SpecLabs (orchestrate-validate) - Automated verification
    ‚Üì
SpecSwarm (analyze-quality) - Production validation
```

## Phase 0 Status

### Current Capabilities

**Autonomous Development**:
- ‚úÖ Task workflow parsing
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive prompt generation
- ‚úÖ Multi-agent coordination
- ‚úÖ Browser automation (Playwright)
- ‚úÖ Console/network error capture
- ‚úÖ Screenshot capture

**Advanced Debugging**:
- ‚úÖ Multi-bug problem analysis
- ‚úÖ Strategy determination (sequential vs orchestrated)
- ‚úÖ Logging strategy generation
- ‚úÖ Analysis templates
- ‚úÖ Orchestration planning (3+ bugs)
- ‚úÖ Verification checklists

### Known Limitations

**Autonomous Development**:
- ‚ùå No retry logic on failures
- ‚ùå Manual visual analysis required
- ‚ùå Single task execution only
- ‚ùå No multi-step user flows
- ‚ùå Limited error recovery

**Advanced Debugging**:
- ‚ùå Manual logging implementation (not automated)
- ‚ùå No automated log analysis

## Best Practices

### Autonomous Development

1. **Write Clear Workflows**
   - Be specific about changes required
   - List all files to modify
   - Define clear validation criteria
   - Provide expected outcomes

2. **Review Agent Work**
   - Don't blindly trust agent output
   - Verify changes make sense
   - Test thoroughly before committing
   - Watch for unintended modifications

3. **Start Small**
   - Begin with simple tasks
   - Build confidence gradually
   - Learn agent capabilities/limitations
   - Expand scope as you gain experience

### Advanced Debugging

1. **Be Specific in Problem Descriptions**
   ```bash
   # Good
   /speclabs:coordinate "Login button doesn't respond, password reset email fails, session expires immediately"

   # Too vague
   /speclabs:coordinate "Auth is broken"
   ```

2. **Follow the Phases**
   - Don't skip logging strategy
   - Capture evidence systematically
   - Document root causes thoroughly
   - Use orchestration for 3+ bugs

3. **Use Debug Sessions**
   - Archive sessions for learning
   - Review patterns across sessions
   - Improve logging strategies over time
   - Build debugging playbooks

## Examples

### Example 1: Autonomous Bug Fix

```bash
# 1. Create test workflow
cat > features/001-navbar-fix/test-workflow.md <<'EOF'
# Test: Fix Navbar Update After Sign-In

## Description
Navbar doesn't update to show user info after successful sign-in

## Files to Modify
- app/components/Navbar.tsx
- app/routes/_index.tsx

## Changes Required
1. Add user data to loader in _index.tsx
2. Update Navbar to re-render on user change
3. Ensure proper cache invalidation

## Expected Outcome
After sign-in, navbar immediately shows username and logout button

## Validation
- [ ] Navbar shows username after sign-in
- [ ] Logout button appears
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] No full page refresh required
EOF

# 2. Execute autonomous fix
/speclabs:orchestrate-test features/001-navbar-fix/test-workflow.md /home/marty/my-app

# 3. Validate results
/speclabs:orchestrate-validate /home/marty/my-app

# 4. Review screenshot
Read /tmp/orchestrator-validation-screenshot.png

# 5. If successful, run production quality validation
/specswarm:analyze-quality
```

### Example 2: Multi-Bug Debugging

```bash
# 1. Start systematic debugging
/speclabs:coordinate "navbar not updating, sign-out broken, like button blank page"

# Creates:
# .debug-sessions/20251015-143500/
#   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ problem-description.md (3 issues identified)
#   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logging-strategy.md (template)
#   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

# 2. Fill in logging strategy
# [Edit logging-strategy.md to identify suspected files and logging points]

# 3. Implement logging
# [Add console.log statements as specified]

# 4. Run app and reproduce issues
# [Capture logs]

# 5. Analyze and fill in analysis template
# [Document root causes]

# 6. Review orchestration plan
# [Created automatically for 3+ bugs]

# 7. Execute fixes (manual or orchestrated)

# 8. Verify with checklist
# [Complete verification-checklist.md]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Orchestrate-Test Fails

**Agent doesn't understand task**:
- Make workflow description more specific
- List exact file paths to modify
- Provide code examples in workflow
- Break into smaller tasks

**Agent makes wrong changes**:
- Review workflow clarity
- Check if files exist at specified paths
- Verify project is in correct state
- Consider manual implementation

**Validation fails**:
- Check dev server is running
- Verify URL is correct
- Review screenshot for visual issues
- Check validation results JSON

### Orchestrate-Validate Fails

**Dev server not running**:
```bash
cd /path/to/project
npm run dev
```

**Playwright installation fails**:
```bash
cd /path/to/project
npm install --save-dev playwright
npx playwright install
```

**Browser can't navigate**:
- Check URL is accessible in browser manually
- Ensure no authentication required
- Verify no blocking errors

### Coordinate Issues

**Debug session not created**:
- Ensure you're in a git repository
- Check write permissions
- Verify problem description provided

**Strategy incorrect**:
- Manually adjust if needed
- Edit problem-description.md
- Choose sequential or orchestrated based on context
