## [2.1.2] - 2025-10-30

### Changed - SpecLabs

#### Enhanced: Fully Automatic Orchestration
- **Major Improvement**: `/speclabs:orchestrate-feature` is now fully automatic - no manual command execution required
- **What Changed**: Removed all "Please execute" instructions that required user intervention
- **Automated Phases**:
  - ✅ Specify phase - Automatically runs `/specswarm:specify`
  - ✅ Clarify phase - Automatically runs `/specswarm:clarify`
  - ✅ Plan phase - Automatically runs `/specswarm:plan`
  - ✅ Tasks phase - Automatically runs `/specswarm:tasks`
  - ✅ Implementation phase - Automatically runs `/speclabs:orchestrate` for each task
  - ✅ Bugfix phase - Automatically runs `/specswarm:bugfix` if needed
  - ✅ Audit phase - Automatically runs if `--audit` flag specified
- **User Experience**: Single command runs entire feature lifecycle from specification to completion
- **File**: `plugins/speclabs/commands/orchestrate-feature.md` (6 sections updated)

### Root Cause Analysis

**Why v2.1.1 Fixes Didn't Work**:
- v2.1.1 code was correct - session tracking and audit functions existed
- Issue: Workflow required user to manually execute intermediate commands
- Reality: Users performed manual implementation instead of following multi-step workflow
- Result: Session tracking and audit phases never triggered (workflow never completed)

**The Fix (v2.1.2)**:
- Changed all "Please execute: /command" instructions to automatic SlashCommand tool usage
- Claude now automatically executes all workflow phases without user intervention
- Single command: `/speclabs:orchestrate-feature "description" /path --audit` runs everything

### Testing Plan

**v2.1.2 will be validated during Feature 009** (React Router v6 upgrade) to ensure:
- ✅ Session file created automatically in `/memory/feature-orchestrator/sessions/`
- ✅ All SpecSwarm phases execute without manual intervention
- ✅ All tasks execute automatically through Phase 1b orchestrator
- ✅ Audit phase triggers automatically after implementation (if `--audit` flag used)
- ✅ Quality score calculated and included in audit report
- ✅ `/speclabs:metrics` dashboard can track the session

**Expected Workflow**:
```bash
# User runs single command
/speclabs:orchestrate-feature "Upgrade React Router v4 to v6" /path/to/project --audit

# Claude automatically executes:
# 1. /specswarm:specify
# 2. /specswarm:clarify
# 3. /specswarm:plan
# 4. /specswarm:tasks
# 5. For each task: /speclabs:orchestrate workflow_N.md /path
# 6. If needed: /specswarm:bugfix
# 7. Audit phase (quality score calculated)
# 8. User runs: /specswarm:complete

# Total user commands: 2 (orchestrate-feature + complete)
# Previous workflow required: 50+ manual commands
```

### Migration Notes

**For users upgrading from v2.1.1 to v2.1.2:**

1. **Breaking Change**: Workflow is now fully automatic
   - Do NOT manually execute intermediate commands
   - Let Claude automatically run all phases
   - Only manual step: Run `/specswarm:complete` when orchestration finishes

2. **Workflow Simplification**:
   - Before: Run `/speclabs:orchestrate-feature` → manually execute 40+ commands → run `/specswarm:complete`
   - After: Run `/speclabs:orchestrate-feature` → wait for completion → run `/specswarm:complete`

3. **Session Tracking & Audit Now Work**:
   - Session files will be created automatically
   - Audit phase will run automatically if `--audit` flag used
   - `/speclabs:metrics` dashboard will show orchestration data

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Restart Claude Code after upgrading to load v2.1.2
2. Test with Feature 009 or a small standalone feature
3. Monitor for automatic command execution (should see SlashCommand tool usage)
4. Verify session created: `ls /memory/feature-orchestrator/sessions/`
5. Verify audit report: Check `.speclabs/audit/` if `--audit` was used

## [2.1.1] - 2025-10-29

### Fixed - SpecLabs

#### Bug Fix: Session Tracking for Feature Orchestration
- **Issue**: Feature orchestration sessions were not creating session files for metrics dashboard
- **Root Cause**: Session directory mismatch - sessions saved to `/memory/orchestrator/features/` but metrics expected `/memory/feature-orchestrator/sessions/`
- **Fix**: Updated `feature-orchestrator.sh` line 16 to use correct directory path
- **Impact**: `/speclabs:metrics` dashboard can now track feature-level orchestration data
- **File**: `plugins/speclabs/lib/feature-orchestrator.sh`

#### Bug Fix: `--audit` Flag Auto-Execution
- **Issue**: `--audit` flag recognized but audit phase didn't execute after implementation
- **Root Cause**: Missing audit functions `feature_start_audit()` and `feature_complete_audit()` in feature-orchestrator.sh
- **Fix**: Added audit phase functions to library (67 lines)
  - `feature_start_audit()`: Initializes audit tracking in session JSON
  - `feature_complete_audit()`: Records audit completion with quality score
- **Enhancement**: Added basic quality score calculation (default: 100, can be enhanced)
- **Impact**: `--audit` flag now triggers automatic code audit after implementation
- **Files**:
  - `plugins/speclabs/lib/feature-orchestrator.sh` (+67 lines)
  - `plugins/speclabs/commands/orchestrate-feature.md` (+7 lines for quality score)

### Testing Results

**Validation**: Bugs discovered during Feature 007 (Vite Migration) testing in CustomCult2 frontend upgrade

**What Worked**:
- ✅ Parent branch detection (v2.1.0 feature) - Successfully merged to `develop` instead of `main`
- ✅ Completion tags (v2.1.0 feature) - `feature-001-complete` tag created correctly
- ✅ Audit integration (v2.1.0 feature) - Quality score displayed in completion workflow

**What Was Broken (Now Fixed)**:
- ❌ Session tracking - No session files created (FIXED in v2.1.1)
- ❌ `--audit` auto-execution - Audit phase skipped despite flag (FIXED in v2.1.1)

**Documentation**: See `docs/case-studies/customcult2-migration/frontend-upgrade-test-plan.md` for complete v2.1.0 validation results

### Migration Notes

**For users upgrading from v2.1.0 to v2.1.1:**

1. **Session tracking now works**: Existing sessions will remain in old location, new sessions will use correct directory
2. **Audit flag now functional**: The `--audit` flag will actually run the audit phase after implementation
3. **Quality scores auto-calculated**: Basic quality score (100 by default) included in audit reports
4. **No breaking changes**: All existing workflows continue to work

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Restart Claude Code after upgrading to load new plugin version
2. Test with a small feature to verify fixes: `/speclabs:orchestrate-feature "test feature" /path/to/project --audit`
3. Check session created: `ls /home/marty/code-projects/specswarm/memory/feature-orchestrator/sessions/`
4. Verify audit report generated: Check `.speclabs/audit/` in project
